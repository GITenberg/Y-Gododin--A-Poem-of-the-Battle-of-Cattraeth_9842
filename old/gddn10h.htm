<h1>Y GODODIN</h1>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Aneurin, the author of this poem, was the son of Caw, lord of Cwm
Cawlwyd, or Cowllwg, a region in the North, which, as we learn from
a Life of Gildas in the monastery of Fleury published by Johannes a
Bosco, comprehended Arecluta or Strath Clyde. <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a">{0a}</a>&nbsp;
Several of his brothers seem to have emigrated from Prydyn in company
with their father before the battle of Cattraeth, and, under the royal
protection of Maelgwn Gwynedd, to have settled in Wales, where they
professed religious lives, and became founders of churches.&nbsp; He
himself, however, remained behind, and having been initiated into the
mysteries of Bardism, formed an intimate acquaintance with Owen, Cian,
Llywarch Hen, and Taliesin, all likewise disciples of the Awen.&nbsp;
By the rules of his order a Bard was not permitted ordinarily to bear
arms, <a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b">{0b}</a> and though
the exceptional case, in which he might act differently, may be said
to have arisen from &ldquo;the lawlessness and depredation&rdquo; <a name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c">{0c}</a>
of the Saxons, Aneurin does not appear to have been present at Cattraeth
in any other capacity than that of a herald Bard.&nbsp; Besides the
absence of any intimation to the contrary, we think the passages where
he compares Owen to himself, and where he makes proposals at the conference,
and above all where he attributes his safety to his &ldquo;gwenwawd,&rdquo;
conclusive on the subject.&nbsp; His heraldic character would be recognised
by all nations, according to the universal law of warfare, whereas it
is very improbable that any poetic effusion which he might have delivered,
could have influence upon a people whose language differed so materially
from his own.</p>
<p>The Gododin was evidently composed when the various occurrences that
it records were as yet fresh in the author&rsquo;s mind and recollection.&nbsp;
It is divided into stanzas, which, though they now amount to only ninety-seven,
are supposed to have originally corresponded in point of number with
the chieftains that went to Cattraeth.&nbsp; This is strongly intimated
in the declaration subjoined to Gorchan Cynvelyn, and cited in the notes
at page 86, and thence would we infer that the Gorchanau themselves
are portions of the Gododin, having for their object the commemoration
of the persons whose names they bear.&nbsp; Of course all of them, with
the exception of the short one of Adebon, contain passages that have
been transposed from other stanzas, which may account for their disproportionate
lengths.&nbsp; This is especially the case with Gorchan Maelderw, the
latter, and by far the greater portion whereof, is in the Carnhuanawc
MS. detached from the former, and separately entitled &ldquo;Fragments
of the Gododin and other pieces of the sixth century.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
they were &ldquo;incantations,&rdquo; cannot be admitted; and if the
word &ldquo;gorchan,&rdquo; or &ldquo;gwarchan&rdquo; mean here anything
except simply &ldquo;a canon, or fundamental part of song,&rdquo; we
should be inclined to consider it as synonymous with &ldquo;gwarthan,&rdquo;
and to suppose that the poems in question referred to the camps of Adebon,
Maelderw, and Cynvelyn:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Gwarchan Cynvelyn ar Ododin.&rdquo; <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d">{0d}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>According to the tenor of the Cynvelyn statement, every stanza would
bring before us a fresh hero.&nbsp; This principle we have not overlooked
in the discrimination and arrangements of proper names, though owing
to evident omissions and interpolations, an irregularity in this respect
occasionally and of necessity occurs.</p>
<p>Aneurin, like a true poet of nature, abstains from all artful introduction
or invocation, and launches at once into his subject.&nbsp; His eye
follows the gorgeously and distinctively armed chiefs, as they move
at the head of their respective companies, and perform deeds of valour
on the bloody field.&nbsp; He delights to enhance by contrast their
domestic and warlike habits, and frequently recurs to the pang of sorrow,
which the absence of the warriors must have caused to their friends
and relatives at home, and reflects with much genuine feeling upon the
disastrous consequences, that the loss of the battle would entail upon
these and their dear native land.&nbsp; And though he sets forth his
subject in the ornamental language of poetry, yet he is careful not
to transgress the bounds of truth.&nbsp; This is strikingly instanced
in the manner in which he names no less than four witnesses as vouchers
for the correctness of his description of Caradawg.&nbsp; Herein he
produces one of the &ldquo;three agreements that ought to be in a song,&rdquo;
viz. an agreement &ldquo;between truth and the marvellous.&rdquo; <a name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e">{0e}</a></p>
<p>He also gives &ldquo;relish to his song,&rdquo; <a name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f">{0f}</a>
by adopting &ldquo;a diversity of structure in the metre;&rdquo; for
the lyric comes in occasionally to relieve the solemnity of the heroic,
whilst at the same time the latter is frequently capable of being divided
into a shorter verse, a plan which has been observed in one of the MSS.
used on the present occasion; e. g. the twelfth stanza is thus arranged,
-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But though Aneurin survived the battle of Cattraeth to celebrate
the memory of his less fortunate countrymen in this noble composition,
he also ultimately met with a violent death.&nbsp; The Triads relate
that he was killed by the blow of an axe, inflicted upon his head by
Eiddin son of Einigan, which event was in consequence branded as one
of &ldquo;the three accursed deeds of the Isle of Britain.&rdquo; <a name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g">{0g}</a></p>
<p>His memory, however, lived in the Gododin, and the estimation in
which the poem was held by his successors has earned for him the title
of &ldquo;medeyrn beirdd,&rdquo; the king of Bards.&nbsp; Davydd Benvras
1190-1240, prays for that genius which would enable him</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;To sing praises as Aneurin of yore,<br />The day he sang the
Gododin. <a name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h">{0h}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Risserdyn 1290-1340 in an Ode to Hywel ab Gruffydd speaks of</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;A tongue with the eloquence of Aneurin of splendid song.&rdquo;
<a name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i">{0i}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And Sevnyn 1320-1378 asserts that</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The praise of Aneurin is proclaimed by thousands.&rdquo; <a name="citation0j"></a><a href="#footnote0j">{0j}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Such is the language in which the medi&aelig;val Bards were accustomed
to talk of the author of the Gododin.</p>
<p>The basis of the present translation is a MS. on vellum apparently
of about the year 1200.&nbsp; In that MS. the lines are all written
out to the margin, without any regard to the measure.&nbsp; Capital
letters are never introduced but at the beginning of paragraphs, where
they are ornamented and coloured alternately red and green.&nbsp; At
page 20 Gwilym Tew and Rhys Nanmor <a name="citation0k"></a><a href="#footnote0k">{0k}</a>
are mentioned as the owners of the Book, but the names are written in
a hand, and with letters more modern than the MS.&nbsp; It at one time
belonged to Mr. Jones the Historian of Brecknockshire, and came latterly
into the possession of the late Rev. T. Price, with whose Executrix,
Mrs. E. Powell of Abergavenny, it now remains.&nbsp; The author of the
Celtic Researches took a transcript of it, which he communicated to
the Rev. W. J. Rees, of Cascob, who had previously copied the said transcript
by the permission of the Rev. E. Davies.&nbsp; Mr. Rees&rsquo;s copy
was afterwards collated by Dr. Meyer with Mr. Davies&rsquo;s transcript,
and the only inaccuracy which had crept in was by him carefully corrected.&nbsp;
Dr. Meyer again transcribed Mr. Rees&rsquo;s copy for the use of the
present work, and that version in its turn has been collated by Mr.
Rees, during the progress of the work through the press, with the transcript
in his possession.&nbsp; To these two gentlemen the translator is under
deep obligations.</p>
<p>Also to Mr. Owen Williams of Waunfawr, for the loan of three other
manuscript copies of the Gododin.&nbsp; Two of them occur in the same
book, which purports to have been a transcript made by the Rev. David
Ellis, the first part, A.D. 1775 of an old book, the second part, June
7, 1777, of a book supposed to have been written by Sion Brwynog about
the year 1550.&nbsp; In these versions the stanzas are not divided.&nbsp;
The third version appears in a book containing a variety of poems and
articles in prose, of which, however, the writer or copyist is not known,
though one &ldquo;Davydd Thomas&rdquo; is mentioned in a poor modern
hand as being the owner.&nbsp; Our poem is therein headed &ldquo;Y Gododin.&nbsp;
Aneurin ae cant.&nbsp; Gyd&acirc; nodau y Parchedig Evan Evans.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These &ldquo;nodau&rdquo; are marginal notes, and evidently the different
readings of another version.</p>
<p>The different copies or versions used are distinguished as follow;
-</p>
<p>Myvyrian ... 1<br />D. Ellis ... 2<br />Ditto ... 3<br />D. Thomas
... 4<br />E. Evans ... 5<br />P. Panton ... 6<br />E. Davies ... 7<br />Dr.
Meyer ... 8</p>
<p>Nos 1 and 6 are those which are printed in the Archaiology of Wales,
vol. i.&nbsp; All words that differ in form or meaning, though not in
orthography, from those of No. 7, are duly arranged at the foot of the
page <a name="citation0l"></a><a href="#footnote0l">{0l}</a>, from which
it will be seen that 1, 2, 3, 5, generally agree one with the other,
whilst 4 and 6 also for the most part go together.</p>
<p>It is to be observed, moreover, that though we have taken No. 7 as
our text, we have not servilely confined ourself to it, but that wherever
any of the other versions have been considered preferable, we have unhesitatingly
adopted them.&nbsp; The different meanings, however, are generally inserted
in the notes.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The country situate between the Humber and the Clyde in North Britain
was, for the most part, originally occupied by the Cymry, who here,
as well as in the west, displayed no mean valour in opposition to the
Roman arms.&nbsp; The latter certainly prevailed; nevertheless it is
to be noticed that they did not finally destroy, nor indeed to any material
extent alter the national features of Prydyn.&nbsp; This is evident
from the manner in which the conquerors thought fit to incorporate into
their own geographical vocabulary many of the local names, which they
found already in use; and above all from the purely ancestral character
which the native chieftains exhibited on emerging from the Roman ruins
in the fifth century.&nbsp; Indeed to permit the defeated princes, under
certain restrictions, to enjoy their former rights and jurisdictions,
was perfectly in accordance with the usual policy of the Romans, as
we may learn from the testimony of Tacitus, who remarks, in reference
to the British king Cogidunus, that they granted to him certain states
according to ancient custom, and the reason assigned is that they might
have even kings as instruments of slavery. <a name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a">{1a}</a>&nbsp;
The homage of the subjugated provinces seems to have consisted principally
in the payment of a tribute of money, and the furnishing of soldiers
for foreign service.</p>
<p>Such, no doubt, was the position of Cunedda Wledig, who &ldquo;began
to reign about A.D. 328, and died in 389&rdquo;; <a name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b">{1b}</a>and
who, according to the Historia Britonum attributed to Nennius, &ldquo;venerat
de parte sinistrali, id est, de regione qu&aelig; vocatur Manau Guotodin,&rdquo;
<a name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c">{1c}</a> the heights
of Gododin, and the same apparently with the territory of the Ottadeni.</p>
<p>In the Myvyrian Archaiology, v. 1, p. 71, is printed an Elegy on
Cunedda, the work of one who had actually partaken of his royal munificence,
who had received from him &ldquo;milch cows, horses, wine, oil, and
a host of slaves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer with respect to the martial
prowess of his patron, observes,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Trembling with fear of Cunedda,<br />Will be Caer Weir and
Caer Liwelydd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And again,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred times ere his shield was shattered in battle,<br />Bryneich
obeyed his commands in the conflict.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The modern names of the localities, mentioned in these extracts,
are respectively Warwick, Carlisle <a name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a">{2a}</a>
and Bernicia.&nbsp; The two latter are in the immediate vicinity of
the Ottadeni; the former, being further removed, would indicate the
direction and extent of his arms.</p>
<p>From other sources we learn that Cunedda was the son of Edeyrn ab
Padarn Peisrudd, by Gwawl, daughter of Coel Godebog, and that he was
entitled, in right of his mother, to certain territories in Wales.&nbsp;
When these were invaded by the Gwyddyl, his sons, twelve in number,
left their northern home for the purpose of recovering the same, in
which they were successful, though the enemy was not finally extirpated
until the battle at Cerrig y Gwyddyl, in the succeeding generation.&nbsp;
It is asserted by some that Cunedda accompanied his sons in this expedition,
and that it was undertaken as much through inability to retain possession
of their more immediate dominions, as from the desire of acquiring or
regaining other lands.&nbsp; However, though the sons settled in Wales
and on its borders, it is more accordant with the drift of the Poem,
already cited, to suppose that Cunedda himself died in the North.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it is undoubted that the native chieftains began to suffer
in that part of the island from barbarian incursions even before the
departure of the Romans.&nbsp; Thus Ammianus Marcellinus, with reference
to the year 364, bears testimony, that &ldquo;the Picts and Saxons and
Scots and Attacots harassed the Britons with continual oppressions.&rdquo;
<a name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b">{2b}</a></p>
<p>The final abandonment of the island by the Romans occurred, according
to Zosimus, about A.D. 408 or 409, at which time the native princes
arose to the full enjoyment of feudal dignity and power.&nbsp; In the
North, among others, we find Pabo Post Prydain, a descendant of Coel
Godebog in the 4th degree, and Cynvarch Oer, a member of another branch
of the same family; both of whom, however, were compelled by the inroads
of the predatory hordes, to leave their territories and seek refuge
in Wales, though it would appear that Urien, son of the latter, succeeded
subsequently in recovering his paternal dominion.</p>
<p>The struggle continued, and the enemies had gradually extended themselves
along the coasts, when in 547 they received an important reinforcement
by the arrival of Ida with forty ships.&nbsp; Gododin, Deivyr, and Bryneich,
being situated on the eastern shore, would be especially exposed to
the ravages of these marauders.&nbsp; Indeed it does not appear that
Gododin ever recovered its pristine independence after the death of
Cunedda, at least we do not hear that any of his sons subsequently asserted
their claims to it, or had anything to do with the administration of
its government: they all seem to have ended their days in their western
dominions.&nbsp; Deivyr and Bryneich, however, were more fortunate,
for we find that they were ruled as late as the 6th century by British
monarchs, among whom are named Gall, Diffedell, and Disgyrnin, the sons
of Disgyvyndawd; <a name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a">{3a}</a>
though there is reason to believe that at that time they were in treacherous
alliance with the Saxons.&nbsp; A Triad positively affirms, that &ldquo;there
were none of the Lloegrwys who did not coalesce with the Saxons, save
such as were found in Cornwall, and in the Commot of Carnoban in Deivyr
and Bryneich.&rdquo; <a name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b">{3b}</a>&nbsp;
And it is a remarkable fact, as corroborative of this statement, that
the Cymry ever after, as may be seen in the works of the Bards, applied
the term Bryneich to such of their kindred as joined with the enemies
of their country.</p>
<p>Certain it is, that, at the period of our Poem, the people of the
three provinces in question were open enemies of the Cymry, as appears
from stanzas iii, v, and ix.&nbsp; When we see there how the Bard commends
one hero for not yielding to the army of Gododin, and celebrates the
praise of another who committed an immense slaughter amongst the men
of Deivyr and Bryneich, and threatens, in the case of a third party,
that if they were suspected of leaning to the Bernician interest, he
would himself raise his hand against them, we can come to no other conclusion
than that those countries were arrayed against the Cymry when the battle
of Cattraeth took place.</p>
<p>Ida had to encounter a powerful opponent in the person of Urien,
king of Rheged, a district in or near which Cattraeth lay, as we infer
from two poems of Taliesin.&nbsp; Thus, one entitled &ldquo;Gwaith Gwenystrad,&rdquo;
commences with the words,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Extol the men of Cattraeth, who, with the dawn,<br />Went
with their victorious leader<br />Urien, a renowned elder.&rdquo; <a name="citation3c"></a><a href="#footnote3c">{3c}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the other, called &ldquo;Yspail Taliesin,&rdquo; Urien is styled
&ldquo;Glyw Cattraeth,&rdquo; the ruler of Cattraeth. <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a">{4a}</a>&nbsp;
At the same time he is generally spoken of under the title of Rheged&rsquo;s
chief.</p>
<p>The leader of the hostile forces in the battle of Gwenystrad is not
named, but in the battle of Argoed Llwyvein we find him to be Flamddwyn
or the Torch bearer, a name by which the Britons delighted to designate
the formidable Ida.&nbsp; Flamddwyn&rsquo;s army on this occasion consisted
of four legions, which reached from Argoed to Arvynydd, and against
them were arrayed the men of Goddeu and Rheged, under the command of
Ceneu ab Coel, and Owain, and &ldquo;Urien the prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argoed, bordering on Deivyr and Bryneich, was ruled by Llywarch Hen,
who after his abdication and flight into Powys, pathetically records
the loyal attachment of his former subjects, -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The men of Argoed have ever supported me.&rdquo; <a name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b">{4b}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Historia Britonum enumerates three other kings, who with Urien
fought against the Saxons in the North, viz., Rhydderch, Gwallawg, and
Morgant, though the latter, under the impulse of envy, procured the
assassination of Urien, in the Isle of Lindisfarne.</p>
<p>After the Saxons had finally established themselves on the eastern
coast, in the forementioned countries, an immense rampart, extending
nearly from the Solway to the Frith of Forth, was erected, either with
the view of checking their further progress westward, or else by mutual
consent of the two nations, as a mere line of demarcation between their
respective dominions.&nbsp; This wall cannot have an earlier date, for
it runs through the middle of the country originally occupied by the
Gadeni, and could not of course have been constructed as a boundary
by them; nor can it be referred to a more recent period, as there could
be no reason for forming such a fence after the Saxons had intruded
upon the whole country which it divides.&nbsp; This was the famous CATRAIL,
which we presume to be identical with CATTRAETH, where the disastrous
battle of that name, as sung by Aneurin, was fought.</p>
<p>Catrail means literally &ldquo;the war fence&rdquo; (cad-rhail),
but on the supposition that it is synonymous with Cattraeth, the rhyme
in the Gododin would determine the latter to be the correct term, or
that by which Aneurin distinguished the line.&nbsp; The meaning of Cattraeth
would be either &ldquo;the war tract&rdquo; (cad-traeth), or &ldquo;the
legal war fence&rdquo; (cad-rhaith); the latter of which would give
some countenance to the idea that it was formed by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>The whole course of the Catrail, which may be traced from the vicinity
of Galashiels to Peel-fell, is upwards of forty five miles.&nbsp; The
most entire parts of it show that it was originally a broad and deep
fosse; having on each side a rampart, which was formed of the natural
soil, that was thrown from the ditch, intermixed with some stones.&nbsp;
Its dimensions vary in different places, which may be owing to its remains
being more or less perfect.&nbsp; In those parts where it is pretty
entire, the fosse is twenty seven, twenty six, and twenty five feet
broad.&nbsp; But in those places where the rampart has been most demolished
the fosse only measures twenty two and a half feet, twenty and eighteen,
and in one place only sixteen feet wide.&nbsp; As the ramparts sloped
on the inside, it is obvious that in proportion as they were demolished,
the width of the fosse within would be diminished.&nbsp; In some of
the most entire parts the ramparts are from six to seven, and even nine
or ten feet high, and from eight to ten and twelve feet thick.&nbsp;
They are, no doubt, less now than they were originally, owing to the
effects of time and tillage. <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a">{5a}</a></p>
<p>Such is the Catrail, and were it identical with Cattraeth, we should
naturally expect to meet with some allusions to a work of that description
in the body of the Poem.&nbsp; Nor are we herein disappointed, for the
expressions &ldquo;ffosawd,&rdquo; <a name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b">{5b}</a>
&ldquo;clawdd,&rdquo; <a name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c">{5c}</a>
&ldquo;ffin,&rdquo; <a name="citation5d"></a><a href="#footnote5d">{5d}</a>
&ldquo;cladd clodvawr,&rdquo; <a name="citation5e"></a><a href="#footnote5e">{5e}</a>
&ldquo;goglawdd,&rdquo; <a name="citation5f"></a><a href="#footnote5f">{5f}</a>
&ldquo;clawdd gwernin,&rdquo; <a name="citation5g"></a><a href="#footnote5g">{5g}</a>
and &ldquo;gorffin Gododin,&rdquo; <a name="citation5h"></a><a href="#footnote5h">{5h}</a>
are undoubtedly such allusions, though we readily admit that some of
them may, and probably do, refer to the ordinary circular forts of the
Britons, of whom there are several along the line.&nbsp; It may be added
here that Taliesin in his description of the battle of Gwenystrad, where
the men of Cattraeth fought under Urien, speaks of a &ldquo;govwr&rdquo;
or an intrenchment, that was &ldquo;assailed by the laborious toil of
warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus satisfied ourselves as to the nature and locality of
Cattraeth; the general subject of the Poem becomes apparent.&nbsp; It
was a battle fought at the barrier in question between the Cymry and
the Saxons, the most extended in its design and operations on the part
of the former, as it proved to them the most disastrous in its results,
of all that had hitherto taken place between the two people in that
part of the island.</p>
<p>The details of this bloody encounter, as we gather them from the
Poem, were as follow: At the call of Mynyddawg, lord of Eiddin, whose
dominions lay peculiarly exposed, both by sea and land, to the attack
of the enemy, the native chieftains of Prydyn, aided by many of their
relatives and friends from Gwynedd and Cernyw, entered into a mutual
alliance in behalf of their common country. <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a">{6a}</a>&nbsp;
In one place the daughter of Eudav <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b">{6b}</a>
is joined with Mynyddawg, as one upon whose errand the expedition was
undertaken, but whether she was his wife, or ruled over a territory
adjacent to, or equally threatened with his own, does not appear.&nbsp;
The troops under their respective leaders arrived at Eiddin, where they
were sumptuously entertained by Mynyddawg, <a name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c">{6c}</a>
and where they established their head quarters.&nbsp; The generals named
in the Poem amount in number to about ninety, but this was not the third
part of the whole, which consisted of &ldquo;three hundred and sixty
three chieftains wearing the golden torques.&rdquo; <a name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d">{6d}</a>&nbsp;
The aggregate number of men that followed these illustrious leaders
is not told, but if an average may be formed from what we know respecting
a few cases, it will appear to have been immense.&nbsp; Mynyddawg&rsquo;s
retinue consisted of &ldquo;three hundred;&rdquo; <a name="citation6e"></a><a href="#footnote6e">{6e}</a>
there were &ldquo;five battalions of five hundred men each,&rdquo; &ldquo;three
levies of three hundred each;&rdquo; &ldquo;three bold knights&rdquo;
had each &ldquo;three hundred of equal quality;&rdquo; <a name="citation6f"></a><a href="#footnote6f">{6f}</a>
thus averaging about four hundred for each commander, which, multiplied
by three hundred and sixty three, would exhibit an overwhelming army
of a hundred and forty five thousand, and two hundred men!&nbsp; Yet
the Poet describes the numerical advantages possessed by the enemy as
greatly superior.</p>
<p>These forces, being all placed on the western side of the dyke, would
approach the land of their enemies as they marched to the field of battle,
hence the reason why Aneurin uses the expressions &ldquo;Gwyr a aeth
Gattraeth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gwyr a aeth Gododin,&rdquo; as synonymous.</p>
<p>The enemies, as before observed, were the Saxons, aided on this occasion
by many of the Lloegrians, namely, such of the natives as had submitted
to their sway in the provinces they had already conquered.&nbsp; They
concentrated their forces in Gododin, and marched westward in the direction
of the great fence, where the Britons were awaiting them.&nbsp; Aneurin
has not thought fit to record the names of any of their generals, with
the single exception of Dyvnwal Vrych, <a name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a">{7a}</a>
who, to entitle him to that distinction, must have figured prominently
on the field of battle.</p>
<p>The engagement commenced on a Tuesday, and continued for a whole
week, the last four days being the most bloody. <a name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b">{7b}</a>&nbsp;
For some time both parties fought gallantly, and with almost equal success;
fortune perhaps upon the whole appearing to favour the Cymry, who not
only slew a vast number of their adversaries, but partially succeeded
in recovering their lost dominions. <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c">{7c}</a>&nbsp;
At this critical juncture a dwarfish herald arrived at the fence, proposing
on the part of the Saxons a truce or compact, which, however, was indignantly
rejected by the natives, and the action renewed. <a name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d">{7d}</a>&nbsp;
The scales now rapidly turned.&nbsp; In one part of the field such a
terrible carnage ensued, that there was but one man left to scare away
the birds of prey, which hovered over the carcases of the slain. <a name="citation7e"></a><a href="#footnote7e">{7e}</a>&nbsp;
In another, where our Bard was stationed, a portion of the allied army,
owing to the absence of its general, became panic stricken. <a name="citation7f"></a><a href="#footnote7f">{7f}</a>&nbsp;
Aneurin was taken prisoner, hurried off to a cave or dungeon, and loaded
with chains. <a name="citation7g"></a><a href="#footnote7g">{7g}</a>&nbsp;
At length a conference was submitted to, which was held at a place called
Llanveithin, at which Aneurin, who had been forcibly liberated by one
of the sons of Llywarch Hen, insisted upon the restoration of part of
Gododin, or the alternative of continuing the fight.&nbsp; The Saxon
herald met the proposal by killing the British Bard Owain, who was of
course unarmed. <a name="citation7h"></a><a href="#footnote7h">{7h}</a>&nbsp;
Such a violation of privilege excited then the whole energies of the
Cymry, who rose as one man, and gave the entire scene a more bloody
character than it had yet presented.</p>
<p>Victory, however, at length proclaimed in favour of the usurpers,
and so decisively, that out of the three hundred and sixty three chieftains
that went to the field of Cattraeth, three only returned alive, Cynon,
and Cadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant, besides Aneurin himself. <a name="citation7i"></a><a href="#footnote7i">{7i}</a>&nbsp;
The number of common soldiers that fell must be conjectured.</p>
<p>We have said that the battle commenced on a Tuesday; it would appear
from two passages, namely, where the meeting of reapers in the hall
of Eiddin, <a name="citation7j"></a><a href="#footnote7j">{7j}</a> and
the employment of Gwynwydd in protecting the corn on the highlands,
<a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a">{8a}</a> are spoken of,
that the time of year in which it occurred was the harvest.</p>
<p>It is not, however, so easy to determine the exact year when all
this happened.&nbsp; Neither Arthur nor Urien are mentioned as being
present, and though the stanzas containing their names may have been
lost, it must be admitted that in the case of such distinguished warriors
reason will not warrant the supposition: the fair inference would be
that they were dead at the time.&nbsp; This view is, moreover, supported
by readings of the Gododin, where certain heroes are compared to the
said chiefs respectively, &ldquo;of Arthur,&rdquo; &ldquo;un Urien,&rdquo;
which would hardly have been done had these latter been alive.&nbsp;
The death of Arthur is placed in the year 542; Owain, who died at Cattraeth,
slew Ida, A.D. 560, and Urien is said to have been assassinated about
567; the battle under consideration must have happened subsequently,
probably about the year usually assigned it, viz., 570.&nbsp; This was
in the reign of Rhun, a descendant in the 4th degree of Cunedda Wledig,
King of Gododin!</p>
<p>The vulgar opinion is that the Britons lost the battle in consequence
of having marched to the field in a state of intoxication; and it must
be admitted that there are many passages in the Poem, which, simply
considered, would seem to favour that view.&nbsp; Nevertheless, granting
that the 363 chieftains had indulged too freely in their favourite beverage,
it is hardly credible that the bulk of the army, on which mainly depended
the destiny of the battle, had the same opportunity of rendering themselves
equally incapacitated, or, if we suppose that all had become so, that
they did not recover their sobriety in seven days!&nbsp; The fact appears
to be, that Aneurin in the instances alluded to, intends merely to contrast
the social and festive habits of his countrymen at home with their lives
of toil and privation in war, after a practise common to the Bards,
not only of that age, but subsequently.&nbsp; Or it may be that the
banquet, at which the British leaders were undoubtedly entertained in
the hall of Eiddin, was looked upon as the sure prelude to war, and
that in that sense the mead and wine were to them as poison.</p>

<h2>THE GODODIN.</h2>

<p>I.</p>
<p>He was a man in mind, in years a youth, <a name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a">{79a}</a><br />And
gallant in the din of war;<br />Fleet, thick-maned chargers <a name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b">{79b}</a><br />Were
ridden <a name="citation79c"></a><a href="#footnote79c">{79c}</a> by
the illustrious hero;<br />A shield, light and broad,<br />Hung on the
flank of his swift and slender steed;<br />His sword was blue and gleaming,<br />His
spurs were of gold, <a name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a">{80a}</a>
his raiment was woollen. <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b">{80b}</a><br />It
will not be my part<br />To speak of thee reproachfully,<br />A more
choice act of mine will be<br />To celebrate thy praise in song;<br />Thou
hast gone to a bloody bier,<br />Sooner than to a nuptial feast; <a name="citation80c"></a><a href="#footnote80c">{80c}</a><br />Thou
hast become a meal for ravens,<br />Ere thou didst reach the front of
conflict. <a name="citation80d"></a><a href="#footnote80d">{80d}</a><br />Alas,
Owain! my beloved friend;<br />It is not meet that he should be devoured
by ravens! <a name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a">{81a}</a><br />There
is swelling sorrow <a name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a">{82a}</a>
in the plain,<br />Where fell in death the only son of Marro.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Adorned with his wreath, leader of rustic warriors, <a name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b">{82b}</a>
whenever he came<br />By his troop unattended, <a name="citation83a"></a><a href="#footnote83a">{83a}</a>
before maidens would he serve the mead;<br />But the front of his shield
would be pierced, <a name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b">{83b}</a>
if ever he heard<br />The shout of war; no quarter would he give to
those whom he pursued;<br />Nor would he retreat from the combat until
blood flowed;<br />And he cut down like rushes <a name="citation83c"></a><a href="#footnote83c">{83c}</a>
the men who would not yield.<br />The Gododin relates, that on the coast
of Mordei, <a name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a">{84a}</a><br />Before
the tents of Madog, when he returned,<br />But one man in a hundred
with him came. <a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b">{84b}</a></p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Adorned with his wreath, the chief of toil, his country&rsquo;s rod
<a name="citation84c"></a><a href="#footnote84c">{84c}</a> of power,<br />Darted
like an eagle <a name="citation84d"></a><a href="#footnote84d">{84d}</a>
to our harbours, <a name="citation84e"></a><a href="#footnote84e">{84e}</a>
when allured<br />To the compact <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a">{85a}</a>
that had been formed; his ensign was beloved, <a name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b">{85b}</a><br />More
nobly was his emblazoned resolution <a name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c">{85c}</a>
performed, for he retreated not,<br />With a shrinking mind, <a name="citation85d"></a><a href="#footnote85d">{85d}</a>
before the host of Gododin.<br />Manawyd, <a name="citation85e"></a><a href="#footnote85e">{85e}</a>
with confidence and strength thou pressest upon the tumultuous fight,<br />Nor
dost thou regard <a name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a">{86a}</a>
either spear or shield;<br />No habitation rich in dainties can be found,<br />That
has been kept out of the reach of thy warriors&rsquo; charge. <a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b">{86b}</a></p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Adorned with a wreath was the leader, <a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a">{87a}</a>
the wolf <a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b">{87b}</a>
of the holme,<br />Amber beads <a name="citation87c"></a><a href="#footnote87c">{87c}</a>
in ringlets encircled his temples; <a name="citation87d"></a><a href="#footnote87d">{87d}</a><br />Precious
was the amber, worth a banquet of wine. <a name="citation87e"></a><a href="#footnote87e">{87e}</a><br />He
repelled the violence of men, as they glided along;<br />For Venedotia
and the North would have come to his share,<br />By the advice of the
son of Ysgyran, <a name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a">{88a}</a><br />The
hero of the broken shield. <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b">{88b}</a></p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Adorned with his wreath was the leader, and armed in the noisy conflict;<br />Chief
object of observation <a name="citation88c"></a><a href="#footnote88c">{88c}</a>
was the hero, and powerful in the gory field,<br />Chief fighter <a name="citation88d"></a><a href="#footnote88d">{88d}</a>
in the advanced division, in front of the hosts;<br />Five battalions
<a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a">{89a}</a> fell before
his blades;<br />Even of the men of Deivyr and Bryneich, <a name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b">{89b}</a>
uttering groans,<br />Twenty hundred perished in one short hour;<br />Sooner
did he feed the wolf <a name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a">{90a}</a>
with his carcase, than go to the nuptial feast; <a name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b">{90b}</a><br />He
sooner became the raven&rsquo;s prey, than approached the altar; <a name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c">{90c}</a><br />He
had not raised the spear ere his blood streamed to the ground; <a name="citation90d"></a><a href="#footnote90d">{90d}</a><br />This
was the price of mead in the hall, amidst the throng;<br />Hyveidd Hir
<a name="citation90e"></a><a href="#footnote90e">{90e}</a> shall be
celebrated whilst there remains a minstrel.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Gododin, and Gognaw laughed, <a name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a">{91a}</a><br />But
bitter were they in the battle, <a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b">{91b}</a>
when they stood arranged according to their several banners;<br />Few
were the years of peace which they had enjoyed;<br />The son of Botgad
caused a throbbing by the energy of his hand;<br />They should have
gone to churches to do penance,<br />The old and the young, the bold
and the mighty; <a name="citation91c"></a><a href="#footnote91c">{91c}</a><br />The
inevitable strife of death was about to pierce them.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Gododin, Gwanar <a name="citation92a"></a><a href="#footnote92a">{92a}</a>
laughed,<br />As his jewelled army <a name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b">{92b}</a>
went down <a name="citation92c"></a><a href="#footnote92c">{92c}</a>
to the terrific toil.<br />Thou slayest them with blades, when there
is not much chattering;<br />Thou, powerful supporter of the living
law, producest the silence of death. <a name="citation92d"></a><a href="#footnote92d">{92d}</a></p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth, loquacious was the host;<br />Blue
<a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a">{93a}</a> mead was
their liquor, and it proved their poison; <a name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b">{93b}</a><br />In
marshalled array they cut through the engines of war; <a name="citation93c"></a><a href="#footnote93c">{93c}</a><br />And
after the joyful cry, silence <a name="citation93d"></a><a href="#footnote93d">{93d}</a>
ensued!<br />They should have gone to churches to perform penance;<br />The
inevitable strife of death was about to pierce them.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth, filled with mead and drunk,<br />Compact
and vigorous; <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a">{94a}</a>
I should wrong them were I to neglect their fame;<br />Around the mighty,
red, and murky blades,<br />Obstinately and fiercely the dogs of war
<a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b">{94b}</a> would fight;<br />If
I had judged you to be of the tribe of Bryneich, <a name="citation94c"></a><a href="#footnote94c">{94c}</a><br />Not
the phantom of a man would I have left alive. <a name="citation94d"></a><a href="#footnote94d">{94d}</a><br />I
lost a friend, myself being unhurt,<br />As he openly withstood the
terror of the parental chief;<br />Magnanimously did he refuse the dowry
of his father-in-law; <a name="citation94e"></a><a href="#footnote94e">{94e}</a><br />Such
was the son of Cian <a name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a">{95a}</a>
from the stone of Gwyngwn.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth with the dawn;<br />Their peace was
disturbed by those who feared them;<br />A hundred thousand with three
hundred <a name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b">{95b}</a> engaged
in mutual overthrow;<br />Drenched in gore, they marked the fall of
the lances; <a name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a">{96a}</a><br />The
post of war <a name="citation96b"></a><a href="#footnote96b">{96b}</a>
was most manfully and with gallantry maintained,<br />Before the retinue
of Mynyddawg the Courteous. <a name="citation96c"></a><a href="#footnote96c">{96c}</a></p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth with the dawn;<br />Feelingly did
their relatives <a name="citation96d"></a><a href="#footnote96d">{96d}</a>
regret their absence;<br />Mead they drank, yellow, sweet, ensnaring;<br />That
year is the point to which many <a name="citation96e"></a><a href="#footnote96e">{96e}</a>
a minstrel turns;<br />Redder were their swords than their plumes, <a name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a">{97a}</a><br />Their
blades were white as lime, <a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b">{97b}</a>
and into four parts were their helmets cloven, <a name="citation97c"></a><a href="#footnote97c">{97c}</a><br />Even
those of <a name="citation97d"></a><a href="#footnote97d">{97d}</a>
the retinue of Mynyddawg the Courteous.</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth with the day;<br />Was not the most
celebrated of battles disgraced? <a name="citation97e"></a><a href="#footnote97e">{97e}</a><br />They
put to death <a name="citation98a"></a><a href="#footnote98a">{98a}</a>
Gelorwydd<br />With blades. The gem of Baptism <a name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b">{98b}</a>was
thus widely taunted;&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Better that you should, ere
you join your kindred,<br />Have a gory unction <a name="citation98c"></a><a href="#footnote98c">{98c}</a>
and death far from your native homes,<br />At the hand of the host of
Gododin, when the day arrives.&rdquo;<br />Is not a hero&rsquo;s power
best when tempered with discretion?</p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>The hero <a name="citation98d"></a><a href="#footnote98d">{98d}</a>
marched to Cattraeth with the day;<br />Truly <a name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a">{99a}</a>
he quaffed the white mead on serene nights; <a name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b">{99b}</a><br />Miserable,
though success had been predicted, <a name="citation99c"></a><a href="#footnote99c">{99c}</a><br />Proved
his mission, which he undertook through soaring ambition; <a name="citation99d"></a><a href="#footnote99d">{99d}</a><br />There
hastened not to Cattraeth<br />A chief, with such a magnificent design
of enterprize<br />Blazoned on his standard;<br />Never was there such
a host<br />From the fort of Eiddin, <a name="citation99e"></a><a href="#footnote99e">{99e}</a><br />That
would scatter abroad the mounted ravagers.<br />Tudvwlch Hir, <a name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a">{100a}</a>
deprived of <a name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b">{100b}</a>
his land and towns,<br />Slaughtered the Saxons for seven days; <a name="citation100c"></a><a href="#footnote100c">{100c}</a><br />His
valour should have protected him in freedom; <a name="citation100d"></a><a href="#footnote100d">{100d}</a><br />His
memory is cherished by his fair <a name="citation100e"></a><a href="#footnote100e">{100e}</a>
associates;<br />When Tudvwlch arrived, the supporter of the land, <a name="citation100f"></a><a href="#footnote100f">{100f}</a><br />The
post of the son of Kilydd <a name="citation100g"></a><a href="#footnote100g">{100g}</a>
became a plain of blood.</p>
<p>XIV.</p>
<p>The heroes <a name="citation100h"></a><a href="#footnote100h">{100h}</a>
marched to Cattraeth with the dawn,<br />But none of them received protection
from their shields,<br />To blood they resorted, being assembled in
gleaming armour; <a name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a">{101a}</a><br />In
the van was, loud as thunder, the din of targets. <a name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b">{101b}</a><br />The
envious, the fickle, and the base,<br />Would he tear and pierce with
halberts;<br />From an elevated position <a name="citation101c"></a><a href="#footnote101c">{101c}</a>
he slew, with a blade,<br />In iron affliction, <a name="citation101d"></a><a href="#footnote101d">{101d}</a>
their steel-clad commander; <a name="citation101e"></a><a href="#footnote101e">{101e}</a><br />He
subdued the Mordei that owed him homage; <a name="citation101f"></a><a href="#footnote101f">{101f}</a><br />Before
Erthai <a name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a">{102a}</a>
even an army groaned. <a name="citation102b"></a><a href="#footnote102b">{102b}</a></p>
<p>XV.</p>
<p>When the tale shall be told of the battle of Cattraeth,<br />The
people will utter sighs; <a name="citation102c"></a><a href="#footnote102c">{102c}</a>
long has been their grief on account of the warriors&rsquo; absence;<br />There
will be a dominion without a sovereign, <a name="citation102d"></a><a href="#footnote102d">{102d}</a>
and a smoking land.<br />The sons of Godebog, an upright clan,<br />Bore
the furrower <a name="citation102e"></a><a href="#footnote102e">{102e}</a>
on a long bier.<br />Miserable <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a">{103a}</a>
was the fate, though just the necessity,<br />Decreed for Tudvwlch and
Cyvwlch the Tall; <a name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b">{103b}</a><br />Together
they drank the bright mead by the light <a name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c">{103c}</a>
of torches, <a name="citation103d"></a><a href="#footnote103d">{103d}</a><br />Though
pleasant to the taste, it proved a lasting foe. <a name="citation103e"></a><a href="#footnote103e">{103e}</a></p>
<p>XVI.</p>
<p>Before, above the splendid fort of Eching <a name="citation103f"></a><a href="#footnote103f">{103f}</a>
he shewed a frowning aspect; <a name="citation103g"></a><a href="#footnote103g">{103g}</a><br />Whilst
young and forward men composed his retinue;<br />Before, on the Bludwe,
<a name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a">{104a}</a> would
the horn cheer his heart, <a name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b">{104b}</a><br />Making
all the Mordei full of joy; <a name="citation104c"></a><a href="#footnote104c">{104c}</a><br />Before,
his beverage would be braggett;<br />Before, he displayed the grandeur
of gold and rich purple;<br />Before, pampered steeds would bear him
safe away,<br />Even Gwarthlev, who deserved a comely name; <a name="citation104d"></a><a href="#footnote104d">{104d}</a><br />Before,
the victorious chief would turn aside the ebbing tide;<br />His command
was ever to go forward, <a name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a">{105a}</a>
loth was he to skulk.</p>
<p>XVII.</p>
<p>And now the early leader,<br />The sun, is about to ascend,<br />Sovereign
of the revolving <a name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b">{105b}</a>
lights, <a name="citation105c"></a><a href="#footnote105c">{105c}</a><br />In
the heaven of Britain&rsquo;s isle. <a name="citation105d"></a><a href="#footnote105d">{105d}</a><br />Direful
was the flight before the shaking<br />Of the shield of the pursuing
victor; <a name="citation105e"></a><a href="#footnote105e">{105e}</a><br />Bright
<a name="citation105f"></a><a href="#footnote105f">{105f}</a> was the
horn<br />In the hall of Eiddin; <a name="citation105g"></a><a href="#footnote105g">{105g}</a><br />With
pomp was he bidden <a name="citation105h"></a><a href="#footnote105h">{105h}</a><br />To
the feast of intoxicating mead;<br />He drank the beverage of wine,<br />At
the meeting of reapers; <a name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a">{106a}</a><br />He
drank transparent wine,<br />With a battle-daring purpose. <a name="citation106b"></a><a href="#footnote106b">{106b}</a><br />The
reapers sang of war,<br />War with the shining wing; <a name="citation106c"></a><a href="#footnote106c">{106c}</a><br />The
minstrels sang of war,<br />Of harnessed <a name="citation106d"></a><a href="#footnote106d">{106d}</a>
war,<br />Of winged war.<br />No shield was unexpanded <a name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a">{107a}</a><br />In
the conflict of spears;<br />Of equal age they fell <a name="citation107b"></a><a href="#footnote107b">{107b}</a><br />In
the struggle of battle.<br />Unshaken in the tumult,<br />Without dishonour
<a name="citation107c"></a><a href="#footnote107c">{107c}</a> did he
retaliate on the foe;<br />Buried <a name="citation107d"></a><a href="#footnote107d">{107d}</a>
was whoever he willed,<br />Ere the grave of the gigantic <a name="citation107e"></a><a href="#footnote107e">{107e}</a>
Gwrveling<br />Itself became a green sward.</p>
<p>XVIII.</p>
<p>The complement <a name="citation107f"></a><a href="#footnote107f">{107f}</a>
of the surrounding country <a name="citation107g"></a><a href="#footnote107g">{107g}</a><br />Were,
three forward chiefs of the Novant&aelig;; <a name="citation107h"></a><a href="#footnote107h">{107h}</a><br />Five
battalions of five hundred men each; <a name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a">{108a}</a><br />Three
levies <a name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b">{108b}</a>
of three hundred each;<br />Three hundred knights of battle <a name="citation108c"></a><a href="#footnote108c">{108c}</a><br />From
Eiddin, arrayed in golden armour;<br />Three loricated hosts,<br />With
three kings wearing the golden torques; <a name="citation108d"></a><a href="#footnote108d">{108d}</a><br />Three
bold knights,<br />With three hundred of equal quality;<br />Three of
the same order, mutually jealous,<br />Bitterly would they chase the
foe,<br />Three dreadful in the toil;<br />They would kill a lion flat
as lead. <a name="citation108e"></a><a href="#footnote108e">{108e}</a><br />There
was in the war a collection of gold. <a name="citation108f"></a><a href="#footnote108f">{108f}</a><br />Three
sovereigns of the people<br />Came from amongst the Brython, <a name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a">{109a}</a><br />Cynrig
and Cynon <a name="citation109b"></a><a href="#footnote109b">{109b}</a><br />And
Cynrain <a name="citation109c"></a><a href="#footnote109c">{109c}</a>
from Aeron, <a name="citation109d"></a><a href="#footnote109d">{109d}</a><br />To
greet <a name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a">{110a}</a>
the ashen lances <a name="citation110b"></a><a href="#footnote110b">{110b}</a><br />Of
the men who dropped from Deivyr. <a name="citation110c"></a><a href="#footnote110c">{110c}</a><br />Came
there from the Brython,<br />A better man than Cynon,<br />Who proved
a serpent to his sullen foes?</p>
<p>XIX.</p>
<p>I drank of the wine and the mead of the Mordei;<br />Great was the
quantity of spears,<br />In the assembly of the warriors;<br />He <a name="citation110d"></a><a href="#footnote110d">{110d}</a>
was solemnising a banquet for the eagle.<br />When Cydywal <a name="citation110e"></a><a href="#footnote110e">{110e}</a>
hurried forth to battle, he raised<br />The shout with the green dawn,
and dealt out tribulation, <a name="citation110f"></a><a href="#footnote110f">{110f}</a><br />And
splintered shields about the ground he left,<br />And darts of awful
tearing did he hew down;<br />In the battle, the foremost in the van
he wounded.<br />The son of Syvno, <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a">{111a}</a>
the astronomer, knew,<br />That he who sold his life,<br />In the face
of warning,<br />With sharpened blades would slaughter,<br />But would
himself be slain by spears and crosses. <a name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b">{111b}</a><br />According
to the compact, <a name="citation111c"></a><a href="#footnote111c">{111c}</a>
he meditated a convenient attack,<br />And would boast <a name="citation111d"></a><a href="#footnote111d">{111d}</a>
of a pile of carcases<br />Of gallant men of toil,<br />Whom in the
upper part of Gwynedd <a name="citation111e"></a><a href="#footnote111e">{111e}</a>
he pierced.</p>
<p>XX.</p>
<p>I drank of the wine and the mead of the Mordei,<br />And because
I drank, I fell by the edge of a gleaming sword, <a name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a">{112a}</a><br />Not
without desiring a hero&rsquo;s prowess; <a name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b">{112b}</a><br />And
when all fell, thou didst also fall. <a name="citation112c"></a><a href="#footnote112c">{112c}</a><br />Thus
when the issue comes, it were well not to have sinned.<br />Present,
in his thrusting course, showed a bold and mighty arm. <a name="citation112d"></a><a href="#footnote112d">{112d}</a></p>
<p>XXI.</p>
<p>The heroes who marched to Cattraeth were renowned,<br />Wine and
mead out of golden goblets was their beverage,<br />That year was to
them one of exalted solemnity,<br />Three hundred and sixty-three chieftains,
wearing the golden torques; <a name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a">{113a}</a><br />Of
those who hurried forth after the excess of revelling,<br />But three
escaped by valour from the funeral fosse, <a name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b">{113b}</a><br />The
two war-dogs <a name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a">{114a}</a>
of Aeron, and Cynon the dauntless, <a name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b">{114b}</a><br />And
myself, from the spilling of blood, the reward of my candid song. <a name="citation114c"></a><a href="#footnote114c">{114c}</a></p>
<p>XXII.</p>
<p>My friend in real distress, we should have been by none disturbed,<br />Had
not the white-bannered commander <a name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a">{115a}</a>
led forth his army;<br />We should not <a name="citation115b"></a><a href="#footnote115b">{115b}</a>
have been separated in the hall from the banquet of mead,<br />Had he
not laid waste our convenient groves; <a name="citation115c"></a><a href="#footnote115c">{115c}</a><br />He
crept into the martial field, he crept into our families. <a name="citation115d"></a><a href="#footnote115d">{115d}</a><br />The
Gododin relates how that, after the fight in the fosse,<br />When we
had no dwellings, <a name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a">{116a}</a>
none were more destitute. <a name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b">{116b}</a></p>
<p>XXIII.</p>
<p>Scattered, broken, motionless is the weapon, <a name="citation116c"></a><a href="#footnote116c">{116c}</a><br />That
used to penetrate through the great horde, <a name="citation116d"></a><a href="#footnote116d">{116d}</a>
the numerous <a name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a">{117a}</a>
horde of the Lloegrians. <a name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b">{117b}</a><br />Shields
were strewn on the sea coast, <a name="citation117c"></a><a href="#footnote117c">{117c}</a>
shields in the battle of lances;<br />Men were reduced to ashes, <a name="citation117d"></a><a href="#footnote117d">{117d}</a><br />And
women rendered widows,<br />Before his death. <a name="citation117e"></a><a href="#footnote117e">{117e}</a><br />O
Graid, son of Hoewgi, <a name="citation117f"></a><a href="#footnote117f">{117f}</a><br />With
thy spears<br />Didst thou cause an effusion of blood.</p>
<p>XXIV.</p>
<p>There was the hero, with both his shoulders covered, <a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a">{118a}</a><br />By
a variegated shield, and possessing the swiftness of a warlike steed;<br />There
was a noise in the mount of slaughter, <a name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b">{118b}</a>
there was fire, <a name="citation118c"></a><a href="#footnote118c">{118c}</a><br />Impetuous
were the lances, there was a sunny gleam, <a name="citation118d"></a><a href="#footnote118d">{118d}</a><br />There
was food for ravens, the raven there did triumph, <a name="citation118e"></a><a href="#footnote118e">{118e}</a><br />And
before he would let them go free,<br />With the morning dew, like the
eagle in his glad course,<br />He scattered them on either side, and
like a billow overwhelmed them in front.<br />The Bards of the world
judge those to be men of valour,<br />Whose counsels are not divulged
to slaves. <a name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a">{119a}</a><br />The
spears in the hands of the warriors were causing devastation;<br />And
ere was interred under <a name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b">{119b}</a>
the swan-white steed, <a name="citation119c"></a><a href="#footnote119c">{119c}</a><br />One
who had been energetic in his commands,<br />His gore had thoroughly
washed his armour: <a name="citation119d"></a><a href="#footnote119d">{119d}</a><br />Such
was Buddvan, <a name="citation119e"></a><a href="#footnote119e">{119e}</a>
the son of Bleiddvan the Bold.</p>
<p>XXV.</p>
<p>It were wrong not to record his magnificent feat;<br />He would not
leave an open gap, through cowardice; <a name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a">{120a}</a><br />The
benefit of Britain&rsquo;s minstrels never quitted his court<br />Upon
the calends of January; <a name="citation120b"></a><a href="#footnote120b">{120b}</a>
according to his design, <a name="citation120c"></a><a href="#footnote120c">{120c}</a><br />His
land should not be ploughed, though it might become wild;<br />He was
a mighty dragon of indignant disposition;<br />A commander in the bloody
field, <a name="citation120d"></a><a href="#footnote120d">{120d}</a>
after the feast of wine,<br />Was Gwenabwy <a name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a">{121a}</a>
the son of Gw&ecirc;n, <a name="citation121b"></a><a href="#footnote121b">{121b}</a>
in the strife of Cattraeth.</p>
<p>XXVI.</p>
<p>True it was, as the songs relate, <a name="citation121c"></a><a href="#footnote121c">{121c}</a><br />No
one&rsquo;s steeds <a name="citation121d"></a><a href="#footnote121d">{121d}</a>
overtook Marchleu;<br />The lances <a name="citation121e"></a><a href="#footnote121e">{121e}</a>
hurled by the commanding earl,<br />In his prancing career, <a name="citation121f"></a><a href="#footnote121f">{121f}</a>
strewed a thick path;<br />As he had been reared for slaughter by the
aid of my mother, <a name="citation121g"></a><a href="#footnote121g">{121g}</a><br />Furious
was the stroke of his sword whilst lending support to others; <a name="citation121h"></a><a href="#footnote121h">{121h}</a><br />Ashen
shafts were scattered from the grasp of his hand, <a name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a">{122a}</a><br />Above
the narrow summit <a name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b">{122b}</a>
of the solemn pile, <a name="citation122c"></a><a href="#footnote122c">{122c}</a><br />The
place where one caused the smoke to ascend; <a name="citation122d"></a><a href="#footnote122d">{122d}</a><br />He
would slaughter with the blade, whilst his arms were full of furze;
<a name="citation122e"></a><a href="#footnote122e">{122e}</a><br />As
when a reaping comes in the interval of fine weather, <a name="citation122f"></a><a href="#footnote122f">{122f}</a><br />Would
Marchleu <a name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a">{123a}</a>
make the blood to flow.</p>
<p>XXVII.</p>
<p>Lower down <a name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b">{123b}</a>
was sent from the southern region, <a name="citation123c"></a><a href="#footnote123c">{123c}</a><br />One
whose conduct <a name="citation123d"></a><a href="#footnote123d">{123d}</a>
resembled the flowing sea; <a name="citation123e"></a><a href="#footnote123e">{123e}</a><br />He
was full of modesty and gentleness,<br />When allowed to quaff the mead:<br />But
along the rampart to Offer, <a name="citation123f"></a><a href="#footnote123f">{123f}</a>
even to the point of Maddeu, <a name="citation123g"></a><a href="#footnote123g">{123g}</a><br />Enraged,
he was glutted with carnage, and scattering, with desolation; <a name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a">{124a}</a><br />His
sword resounded on the heads of mothers;<br />He was an ardent spirit,
<a name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b">{124b}</a> praise
be to him, the son of Gwyddneu. <a name="citation124c"></a><a href="#footnote124c">{124c}</a></p>
<p>XXVIII.</p>
<p>Caredig, <a name="citation124d"></a><a href="#footnote124d">{124d}</a>
lovely is his fame;<br />He would protect and guard his ensign,<br />Gentle,
<a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a">{125a}</a> lowly,
calm, before the day arrived<br />When he the pomp of war should learn;<br />When
comes the appointed time of the friend of song, <a name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b">{125b}</a><br />May
he recognise his home in the heavenly region.</p>
<p>XXIX.</p>
<p>Ceredig, <a name="citation125c"></a><a href="#footnote125c">{125c}</a>
amiable leader,<br />A wrestler <a name="citation126a"></a><a href="#footnote126a">{126a}</a>
in the impetuous <a name="citation126b"></a><a href="#footnote126b">{126b}</a>
fight;<br />His golden shield dazzled <a name="citation126c"></a><a href="#footnote126c">{126c}</a>
the field of battle,<br />His lances, when darted, were shivered into
splinters,<br />And the stroke of his sword was fierce and penetrating;<br />Like
a hero would he maintain his post.<br />Before he received the affliction
of earth, <a name="citation126d"></a><a href="#footnote126d">{126d}</a>
before the fatal blow,<br />He had fulfilled his duty in guarding his
station.<br />May he find a complete reception<br />With the Trinity
in perfect Unity.</p>
<p>XXX.</p>
<p>When Caradawg <a name="citation126e"></a><a href="#footnote126e">{126e}</a>
rushed into battle,<br />It was like the tearing onset of the woodland
boar; <a name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a">{127a}</a><br />Bull
of the army in the mangling fight,<br />He allured the wild dogs by
the action of his hand; <a name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b">{127b}</a><br />My
witnesses <a name="citation127c"></a><a href="#footnote127c">{127c}</a>
are Owain the son of Eulat,<br />And Gwrien, and Gwynn, and Gwriad;
<a name="citation127d"></a><a href="#footnote127d">{127d}</a><br />But
from Cattraeth, and its work of carnage, <a name="citation127e"></a><a href="#footnote127e">{127e}</a><br />From
the hill of Hydwn, ere it was gained, <a name="citation127f"></a><a href="#footnote127f">{127f}</a><br />After
the clear mead was put into his hand,<br />He saw no more the hill <a name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a">{128a}</a>
of his father.</p>
<p>XXXI.</p>
<p>The warriors marched with speed, together they bounded onward;<br />Short
lived were they,&mdash;they had become drunk over the distilled mead.<br />The
retinue of Mynyddawg, renowned <a name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b">{128b}</a>
in the hour of need;<br />Their life was the price of their banquet
of mead.<br />Caradawg, <a name="citation128c"></a><a href="#footnote128c">{128c}</a>
and Madawg, <a name="citation128d"></a><a href="#footnote128d">{128d}</a>
Pyll, and Ieuan,<br />Gwgawn, <a name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a">{129a}</a>
and Gwiawn, Gwynn <a name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b">{129b}</a>
and Cynvan,<br />Peredur <a name="citation129c"></a><a href="#footnote129c">{129c}</a>
with steel arms, Gwawrddur, <a name="citation129d"></a><a href="#footnote129d">{129d}</a>
and Aeddan; <a name="citation129e"></a><a href="#footnote129e">{129e}</a><br />A
defence were they in the tumult, though with shattered shields; <a name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a">{130a}</a><br />When
they were slain, they also slaughtered;<br />Not one to his native home
returned.</p>
<p>XXXII.</p>
<p>The heroes marched with speed, together were they regaled<br />That
year over mead, and mighty was their design;<br />How sad to mention
them, <a name="citation130b"></a><a href="#footnote130b">{130b}</a>
how doleful their commemoration! <a name="citation130c"></a><a href="#footnote130c">{130c}</a><br />Poison
is the home to which they have returned, they are not as sons by mothers
nursed; <a name="citation130d"></a><a href="#footnote130d">{130d}</a><br />How
long our vexation, how long our regret,<br />For the brave warriors,
whose native place was the feast of wine! <a name="citation130e"></a><a href="#footnote130e">{130e}</a><br />Gwlyget
<a name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a">{131a}</a> of Gododin,
having partaken of the speech inspiring<br />Banquet of Mynyddawg, performed
illustrious deeds, <a name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b">{131b}</a><br />And
paid a price <a name="citation131c"></a><a href="#footnote131c">{131c}</a>
for the purchase of the battle of Cattraeth.</p>
<p>XXXIII.</p>
<p>The heroes went to Cattraeth in marshalled array, and with shout
of war, <a name="citation131d"></a><a href="#footnote131d">{131d}</a><br />With
powerful steeds, <a name="citation131e"></a><a href="#footnote131e">{131e}</a>
and dark brown harness, and with shields,<br />With uplifted <a name="citation131f"></a><a href="#footnote131f">{131f}</a>
javelins, and piercing lances,<br />With glittering mail, and with swords.<br />He
excelled, and penetrated through the host,<br />Five battalions fell
before his blade;<br />Rhuvawn Hir, <a name="citation132a"></a><a href="#footnote132a">{132a}</a>&mdash;he
gave gold <a name="citation132b"></a><a href="#footnote132b">{132b}</a>
to the altar,<br />And gifts and precious stones <a name="citation132c"></a><a href="#footnote132c">{132c}</a>
to the minstrel.</p>
<p>XXXIV.</p>
<p>No hall <a name="citation132d"></a><a href="#footnote132d">{132d}</a>
was ever made so eminently perfect,<br />So great, so magnificent for
the slaughter; <a name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a">{133a}</a><br />Morien
<a name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b">{133b}</a> procured
<a name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c">{133c}</a> and spread
the fire,<br />And would not say but that Cynon <a name="citation133d"></a><a href="#footnote133d">{133d}</a>
should see <a name="citation133e"></a><a href="#footnote133e">{133e}</a>
the corpse<br />Of one harnessed, armed with a pike, and of a wide spread
fame; <a name="citation133f"></a><a href="#footnote133f">{133f}</a><br />His
sword resounded on the summit occupied by the camp, <a name="citation133g"></a><a href="#footnote133g">{133g}</a><br />Nor
was he moved <a name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a">{134a}</a>
aside in his course by a ponderous stone from the wall of the fort,
<a name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b">{134b}</a><br />And
never again will the son of Peithan <a name="citation134c"></a><a href="#footnote134c">{134c}</a>
be moved.</p>
<p>XXXV.</p>
<p>No hall was ever made so impregnable; <a name="citation134d"></a><a href="#footnote134d">{134d}</a><br />Had
not Morien been like Caradawg, <a name="citation134e"></a><a href="#footnote134e">{134e}</a><br />The
forward Mynawg, <a name="citation134f"></a><a href="#footnote134f">{134f}</a>
with his heavy armour, <a name="citation134g"></a><a href="#footnote134g">{134g}</a>
would not have escaped;<br />Enraged, he was fiercer than the son of
Pherawg, <a name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a">{135a}</a><br />Stout
his hand, and, mounted on his steed, <a name="citation135b"></a><a href="#footnote135b">{135b}</a>
he dealt out flames upon the retreating foe.<br />Terrible in the city
was the cry of the timid multitude,<br />The van of the army of Gododin
was scattered;<br />His buckler <a name="citation135c"></a><a href="#footnote135c">{135c}</a>
was winged with fire for the slaughter;<br />In the day of his wrath
<a name="citation135d"></a><a href="#footnote135d">{135d}</a> he was
nimble&mdash;a destructive retaliator;<br />The dependants of Mynyddawg
deserved their horns of mead.</p>
<p>XXXVI.</p>
<p>No hall was ever made so immoveable<br />As that of Cynon with the
gentle breast, sovereign of the saints; <a name="citation135e"></a><a href="#footnote135e">{135e}</a><br />He
sat no longer on his elevated throne, <a name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a">{136a}</a><br />Whom
he pierced were not pierced again, <a name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b">{136b}</a><br />Keen
was the point of his lance,<br />It perforated the enamelled armour,
it penetrated through the troops;<br />Swift in the van were his horses,
in front they tore along;<br />In the day of his anger <a name="citation136c"></a><a href="#footnote136c">{136c}</a>
blasting was his blade,<br />When Cynon rushed into battle with the
green dawn.</p>
<p>XXXVII.</p>
<p>A grievous descent was made upon his native territory;<br />He <a name="citation136d"></a><a href="#footnote136d">{136d}</a>
suffered an encroachment&mdash;he fixed a limit;<br />His spear forcibly
pushed the laughing chiefs of war;<br />Even as far as Ephyd <a name="citation137a"></a><a href="#footnote137a">{137a}</a>
reached the valour of the forward Elphin:<br />The furze was kindled
by the ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.</p>
<p>A grievous descent was made upon his native territory,<br />The price
of mead in the hall, and the feast of wine;<br />His blades were scattered
about between the two hosts;<br />Illustrious was the knight in front
of Gododin;<br />The furze was kindled by the ardent spirit, the bull
of conflict. <a name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a">{138a}</a></p>
<p>XXXIX.</p>
<p>A grievous descent was made in front of the extended riches, <a name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b">{138b}</a><br />But
the army turned aside, with trailing <a name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c">{138c}</a>
shields,<br />And those shields were shivered before the herd of the
roaring Beli. <a name="citation138d"></a><a href="#footnote138d">{138d}</a><br />A
dwarf from the bloody field hastened to the fence; <a name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a">{139a}</a><br />And
on our side there came a hoary headed man, our chief counsellor, <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b">{139b}</a><br />Mounted
on a prancing iebald psteed, and wearing the golden chain.<br />The
Boar <a name="citation139c"></a><a href="#footnote139c">{139c}</a> proposed
a compact in front of the course&mdash;the great plotter;<br />Right
worthy <a name="citation139d"></a><a href="#footnote139d">{139d}</a>
was the shout of our refusal,<br />And we cried &ldquo;Let heaven be
our protection,<br />Let his compact be that he should be prostrated
by the spear in battle, <a name="citation139e"></a><a href="#footnote139e">{139e}</a><br />Our
warriors, in respect of their far famed fosse, <a name="citation139f"></a><a href="#footnote139f">{139f}</a><br />Would
not quarrel if a host were there to press the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>XL.</p>
<p>For the piercing <a name="citation140a"></a><a href="#footnote140a">{140a}</a>
of the skilful and most learned man, <a name="citation140b"></a><a href="#footnote140b">{140b}</a><br />For
the fair corpse which fell prostrate on the ground,<br />For the cutting
<a name="citation140c"></a><a href="#footnote140c">{140c}</a> of his
hair from his head,<br />For Gwydien, the eagle of the air, <a name="citation140d"></a><a href="#footnote140d">{140d}</a><br />Did
Gwyddwg <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a">{141a}</a>
bring protection to the field, <a name="citation141b"></a><a href="#footnote141b">{141b}</a><br />Resembling
and honouring his master.<br />Morien of the blessed song, brought protection<br />To
the ruined hall, <a name="citation141c"></a><a href="#footnote141c">{141c}</a>
and cleft the heads<br />Of the first in youth, in strength, and in
old age.<br />Equal to three men, though a maid, was Bradwen; <a name="citation141d"></a><a href="#footnote141d">{141d}</a><br />Equal
to twelve was Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen. <a name="citation141e"></a><a href="#footnote141e">{141e}</a></p>
<p>XLI.</p>
<p>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned woman,<br />Her
servant bore a shield in the action,<br />And with energy his sword
fell upon the heads of the foe;<br />In Lloegyr the churls cut their
way before the chieftain. <a name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a">{142a}</a><br />He
who grasps the mane of a wolf, without a club <a name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b">{142b}</a><br />In
his hand, will have it gorgeously emblazoned on his robe. <a name="citation142c"></a><a href="#footnote142c">{142c}</a><br />In
the engagement of wrath and carnage,<br />Bradwen perished,&mdash;she
did not escape.</p>
<p>XLII.</p>
<p>Carcases <a name="citation142d"></a><a href="#footnote142d">{142d}</a>
of gold mailed warriors lay upon the city walls;<br />None of the houses
or cities of Christians <a name="citation142e"></a><a href="#footnote142e">{142e}</a>
was any longer actively engaged in war; <a name="citation142f"></a><a href="#footnote142f">{142f}</a><br />But
one feeble man, with his shouts, kept aloof<br />The roving birds; <a name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a">{143a}</a><br />Truly
Syll of Virein <a name="citation143b"></a><a href="#footnote143b">{143b}</a>

the hour of mattins, <a name="citation143d"></a><a href="#footnote143d">{143d}</a><br />Than

in the uplands,<br />Deservedly were we said to run <a name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a">{144a}</a>
like marked men; <a name="citation144b"></a><a href="#footnote144b">{144b}</a><br />The
entrance to Din Drei <a name="citation144c"></a><a href="#footnote144c">{144c}</a>
was not guarded,<br />There was a mountain with riches <a name="citation144d"></a><a href="#footnote144d">{144d}</a>
for those who should approach it,<br />And there was a city <a name="citation144e"></a><a href="#footnote144e">{144e}</a>

<p>The chief exploit of the North <a name="citation146f"></a><a href="#footnote146f">{146f}</a>
did the hero accomplish,<br />Of a gentle breast, a more liberal lord
could not be seen,<br />Earth does not support, <a name="citation147a"></a><a href="#footnote147a">{147a}</a>
nor has mother borne<br />Such an illustrious, powerful, steel clad
warrior;<br />By the force of his gleaming sword he protected me,<br />From
the cruel subterraneous prison he brought me out,<br />From the chamber
of death, from a hostile region;<br />Such was Ceneu, son of Llywarch,
energetic and bold. <a name="citation147b"></a><a href="#footnote147b">{147b}</a></p>
<p>XLVII.</p>
<p>He would not bear the reproach of a congress, <a name="citation147c"></a><a href="#footnote147c">{147c}</a><br />Senyllt,
<a name="citation147d"></a><a href="#footnote147d">{147d}</a> with his
vessels full of mead;&mdash;<br />His sword rang <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a">{148a}</a>
for deeds of violence,<br />He shouted and bounded with aid for the
war,<br />And with his arm proved a comprehensive <a name="citation148b"></a><a href="#footnote148b">{148b}</a>
support, <a name="citation148c"></a><a href="#footnote148c">{148c}</a><br />Against
the armies of Gododin and Bryneich.<br />Booths for the horses were
prepared in the hall, <a name="citation148d"></a><a href="#footnote148d">{148d}</a><br />There
was streaming gore, and dark brown harness,<br />And from his hand issued
a thread <a name="citation148e"></a><a href="#footnote148e">{148e}</a>
of gleam; <a name="citation148f"></a><a href="#footnote148f">{148f}</a><br />Like
a hunter shooting with the bow<br />Was Gwen; <a name="citation148g"></a><a href="#footnote148g">{148g}</a>
and the attacking parties mutually pushed each other,<br />Friend and
foe by turns;<br />The warriors did not cut their way to flee, <a name="citation148h"></a><a href="#footnote148h">{148h}</a><br />But
were the generous defenders of every region.</p>
<p>XLVIII.</p>
<p>To Llech Leucu, <a name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a">{149a}</a>
the land of Lleu, <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b">{149b}</a>
and Lleudvre, <a name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c">{149c}</a><br />To
the course of Gododin,<br />And to the course of Ragno, close at hand,<br />Even
that hand which directed the splendour of battle,<br />With the branch
of Caerwys, <a name="citation149d"></a><a href="#footnote149d">{149d}</a><br />Before
it was shattered<br />By the season of the storm,&mdash;by the storm
of the season, <a name="citation149e"></a><a href="#footnote149e">{149e}</a><br />To
form a rank against a hundred thousand men, <a name="citation149f"></a><a href="#footnote149f">{149f}</a><br />Coming
from Dindovydd,<br />In the region of Dyvneint, <a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a">{150a}</a><br />Deeply
did they design, <a name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b">{150b}</a><br />Sharply
did they pierce,<br />Wholly did they chant,<br />Even the army with
the battered shields;<br />And before the bull of conflict,<br />The
hostile van was broken.</p>
<p>XLIX.</p>
<p>The foes have in sorrow greatly trembled,<br />Since the battle of
most active tumult,<br />At the border of Ban Carw; <a name="citation150c"></a><a href="#footnote150c">{150c}</a><br />Round
the border of Ban Carw<br />The fingers of Brych <a name="citation150d"></a><a href="#footnote150d">{150d}</a>
were hurt by the shaft of a spear. <a name="citation150e"></a><a href="#footnote150e">{150e}</a><br />In
defence of Pwyll, <a name="citation150f"></a><a href="#footnote150f">{150f}</a>
of Disteir and Distar,<br />In defence of Pwyll, of Rodri, and of Rhychwardd,<br />A
stout <a name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a">{151a}</a>
bow was spent by Rhys <a name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b">{151b}</a>
in Rhiwdrech;<br />They that were not bold would not attain their purpose;<br />None
escaped that was once overtaken and pierced. <a name="citation151c"></a><a href="#footnote151c">{151c}</a></p>
<p>L.</p>
<p>Not meetly was his buckler pierced<br />Upon the flank of his steed;
<a name="citation151d"></a><a href="#footnote151d">{151d}</a><br />Not
meetly did he mount <a name="citation152a"></a><a href="#footnote152a">{152a}</a><br />His
long legged, slender, grey charger;<br />Dark was his shaft, dark,<br />Darker
was his saddle; <a name="citation152b"></a><a href="#footnote152b">{152b}</a><br />Thy
hero <a name="citation152c"></a><a href="#footnote152c">{152c}</a> is
in a cell, <a name="citation152d"></a><a href="#footnote152d">{152d}</a><br />Gnawing
the shoulder of a buck, <a name="citation152e"></a><a href="#footnote152e">{152e}</a><br />May
his hand triumph,<br />But far be the shoulder of venison. <a name="citation152f"></a><a href="#footnote152f">{152f}</a></p>
<p>LI.</p>
<p>It is well that Adonwy came to the support of Gwen; <a name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a">{153a}</a><br />Bradwen
<a name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b">{153b}</a> abandoned
the foaming brine,<br />And fought, slaughtered, and burned, though
Morien<br />She did not surpass in martial deeds.<br />Thou didst not
regard the rear or the van<br />Of the towering, unhelmetted <a name="citation153c"></a><a href="#footnote153c">{153c}</a>
presence;<br />Thou didst not observe the great swelling sea of knights,<br />That
would mangle, and grant no shelter to the Saxons. <a name="citation153d"></a><a href="#footnote153d">{153d}</a></p>
<p>LII.</p>
<p>Gododin! in respect of thee will I demand <a name="citation154a"></a><a href="#footnote154a">{154a}</a><br />The
dales beyond the ridge of Drum Essyd; <a name="citation154b"></a><a href="#footnote154b">{154b}</a><br />The
slave, <a name="citation154c"></a><a href="#footnote154c">{154c}</a>
greedy of wealth, cannot control himself;<br />By the counsel of thy
son, <a name="citation154d"></a><a href="#footnote154d">{154d}</a> let
thy valour shine forth.<br />The place appointed for the conference<br />Was
not mean, <a name="citation154e"></a><a href="#footnote154e">{154e}</a>
in front of Llanveithin; <a name="citation154f"></a><a href="#footnote154f">{154f}</a><br />From
twilight to twilight he revelled; <a name="citation154g"></a><a href="#footnote154g">{154g}</a><br />Splendid
and full was the purple of the pilgrim; <a name="citation154h"></a><a href="#footnote154h">{154h}</a><br />He
killed the defenceless, <a name="citation154i"></a><a href="#footnote154i">{154i}</a>
the delight of the bulwark of toil, <a name="citation154j"></a><a href="#footnote154j">{154j}</a><br />His
inseparable companion, whose voice was like that of Aneurin. <a name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a">{155a}</a></p>
<p>LIII.</p>
<p>Together arise the foremost fighting warriors, <a name="citation155b"></a><a href="#footnote155b">{155b}</a><br />And
in a body march to Cattraeth, with noise and eager speed;<br />The effects
<a name="citation155c"></a><a href="#footnote155c">{155c}</a> of the
mead in the hall, and of the beverage of wine.<br />Blades were scattered
between the two armies<br />By an illustrious knight, in front of Gododin.<br />Furze
was set on fire by the ardent spirit, the bull of battle. <a name="citation155d"></a><a href="#footnote155d">{155d}</a></p>
<p>LIV.</p>
<p>Together arise the expert warriors,<br />And the stranger, <a name="citation155e"></a><a href="#footnote155e">{155e}</a>
the man with the crimson robe, pursue;<br />The encampment is broken
down by the gorgeous pilgrim, <a name="citation156a"></a><a href="#footnote156a">{156a}</a><br />Where
the young deer were in full melody. <a name="citation156b"></a><a href="#footnote156b">{156b}</a><br />Amongst
the spears of Brych <a name="citation156c"></a><a href="#footnote156c">{156c}</a>
thou couldst see no rods; <a name="citation156d"></a><a href="#footnote156d">{156d}</a><br />With
the base the worthy can have no concord; <a name="citation156e"></a><a href="#footnote156e">{156e}</a><br />Morial
<a name="citation156f"></a><a href="#footnote156f">{156f}</a> in pursuit
will not countenance their dishonourable deeds,<br />With his steel
blade ready for the effusion of blood.</p>
<p>LV.</p>
<p>Together arise the associated <a name="citation156g"></a><a href="#footnote156g">{156g}</a>
warriors,<br />Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be proclaimed;<br />There
was slaughtering with axes and blades, <a name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a">{157a}</a><br />And
there was raising large cairns over the heroes of toil.</p>
<p>LVI.</p>
<p>The experienced <a name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b">{157b}</a>
warriors met together,<br />And all with one accord sallied forth; <a name="citation157c"></a><a href="#footnote157c">{157c}</a><br />Short
were their lives, long is the grief of those who loved them;<br />Seven
times their number of Lloegrians had they slain;<br />After the conflict
their wives <a name="citation157d"></a><a href="#footnote157d">{157d}</a>
raised a scream; <a name="citation157e"></a><a href="#footnote157e">{157e}</a><br />And
many a mother has the tear on her eyelash.</p>
<p>LVII.</p>
<p>No hall was ever made so faultless;<br />Nor was there a lion so
generous, a majestic lion on the path, so kind <a name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a">{158a}</a><br />As
Cynon of the gentle breast, the most comely lord.<br />The fame <a name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b">{158b}</a>
of the city extends to the remotest parts;<br />It was the staying <a name="citation158c"></a><a href="#footnote158c">{158c}</a>
shelter of the army, the benefit of flowing melody. <a name="citation158d"></a><a href="#footnote158d">{158d}</a><br />Of
those whom I have seen, or shall hereafter see<br />On earth, engaged
in arms, the battle cry, and war, <a name="citation159a"></a><a href="#footnote159a">{159a}</a>
the most heroic was he,<br />Who slew the mounted ravagers with the
keenest blade;<br />Like rushes did they fall before his hand.<br />O
son of Clydno, <a name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b">{159b}</a>
of lasting <a name="citation159c"></a><a href="#footnote159c">{159c}</a>
fame!&nbsp; I will sing to thee<br />A song of praise, without beginning,

<p>LVIII.</p>
<p>After the feast of wine and the banquet of mead,<br />Enriched with
the first fruits of slaughter,<br />The mother of Spoliation, <a name="citation159e"></a><a href="#footnote159e">{159e}</a><br />Was
the energetic Eidol; <a name="citation159f"></a><a href="#footnote159f">{159f}</a><br />He
honoured the mount of the van, <a name="citation160a"></a><a href="#footnote160a">{160a}</a><br />In
the presence of Victory.<br />The hovering ravens,<br />Ascend in the

foremost spearmen around him thicken, <a name="citation160c"></a><a href="#footnote160c">{160c}</a><br />Like
a crop of green barley, <a name="citation160d"></a><a href="#footnote160d">{160d}</a><br />Without
the semblance of a retreat.<br />Warriors in wonder shake their javelins,<br />With
pouting and pallid lips,<br />Caused by the keenness of the destructive
sword;<br />From the front of the banquet, deprived of sleep<br />They
vigorously spring forth, <a name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a">{161a}</a>
upon the awaking<br />Of the mother <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b">{161b}</a>
of the Lance, the leader of the din.</p>
<p>LIX.</p>
<p>From the feast of wine and the banquet of mead, they marched<br />To
the strife of mail-clad warriors; <a name="citation161c"></a><a href="#footnote161c">{161c}</a><br />I
know no tale of slaughter which records<br />So complete a destruction.<br />Before
Cattraeth loquacious was the host;<br />But of the retinue of Mynyddawg,
greatly to be deplored, <a name="citation162a"></a><a href="#footnote162a">{162a}</a><br />Out
of three hundred <a name="citation162b"></a><a href="#footnote162b">{162b}</a>
men, only one returned.</p>
<p>LX.</p>
<p>From the feast of wine and the banquet of mead, with speed they marched,<br />Men
renowned in difficulty, prodigal of their lives;<br />In fairest order

the viands they together feasted;<br />Wine and mead and tribute <a name="citation162d"></a><a href="#footnote162d">{162d}</a>
they enjoyed.<br />From the retinue of Mynyddawg ruin has come to me;
<a name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a">{163a}</a><br />And
I have lost my general <a name="citation163b"></a><a href="#footnote163b">{163b}</a>
and <a name="citation163c"></a><a href="#footnote163c">{163c}</a> my
true friends.<br />Of the regal army of three hundred men that hastened

be found, when not at home;<br />Yet illusive <a name="citation163e"></a><a href="#footnote163e">{163e}</a>
was the aid which he brought against Gododin;<br />For though apart
from the wine and mead he was unrestrained,<br />He perished <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a">{164a}</a>
on the course;<br />And red stained warriors ride <a name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b">{164b}</a><br />The

the sullen like a serpent;<br />Thou tramplest upon those who in strong

were trampled because of the contribution of mead in the horn; <a name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b">{166b}</a><br />But

until blood flows <a name="citation167f"></a><a href="#footnote167f">{167f}</a>
like bright wine out of glass vessels; <a name="citation167g"></a><a href="#footnote167g">{167g}</a><br />As

filled the river Aeron; <a name="citation168e"></a><a href="#footnote168e">{168e}</a><br />Their

of the eagles of Clwyd, <a name="citation168g"></a><a href="#footnote168g">{168g}</a><br />And
prepared food for the birds of prey.<br />Of those who went to Cattraeth,
wearers of the golden chain,<br />Upon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign

Cynon.</p>
<p>LXVI.</p>
<p>It is incumbent to sing of so many men of skill, <a name="citation169c"></a><a href="#footnote169c">{169c}</a><br />Who

<a name="citation169f"></a><a href="#footnote169f">{169f}</a> and bold,

<p>LXVIII.</p>
<p>The soldiers <a name="citation171a"></a><a href="#footnote171a">{171a}</a>

<p>LXIX.</p>
<p>At the early dawn of morn, <a name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b">{172b}</a><br />There

<p>LXX.</p>
<p>Quickly rising, in a moment of time, <a name="citation173c"></a><a href="#footnote173c">{173c}</a><br />After

in front of the fence, <a name="citation173e"></a><a href="#footnote173e">{173e}</a><br />After
leading his men in close array,<br />In front of a hundred he pierces
the foremost. <a name="citation173f"></a><a href="#footnote173f">{173f}</a><br />Sad
it was that you should have made a pool of blood,<br />As if you but
drank mead in the midst of laughter; <a name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a">{174a}</a><br />But
it was brave of you to slay the little man, <a name="citation174b"></a><a href="#footnote174b">{174b}</a><br />With
the fierce and impetuous stroke of the sword;<br />For like the unrestrained
ocean <a name="citation174c"></a><a href="#footnote174c">{174c}</a>
had the foe <a name="citation174d"></a><a href="#footnote174d">{174d}</a>
put to death<br />A man, who would otherwise have been in rank his equal.</p>
<p>LXXI.</p>
<p>He fell headlong down the precipice, <a name="citation174e"></a><a href="#footnote174e">{174e}</a><br />And
the bushes <a name="citation174f"></a><a href="#footnote174f">{174f}</a>

was a primary law that Owain should ascend upon the course, <a name="citation175b"></a><a href="#footnote175b">{175b}</a><br />And
extend before the onset the branch of peace, <a name="citation175c"></a><a href="#footnote175c">{175c}</a><br />And

<p>Eidol, with frigid blood and pale complexion,<br />Spreading carnage,
when the maid was supreme in judgment; <a name="citation176b"></a><a href="#footnote176b">{176b}</a><br />Owner
of horses and strong trappings,<br />And transparent <a name="citation176c"></a><a href="#footnote176c">{176c}</a>

conducts the battle,<br />Mallet of the land, <a name="citation177b"></a><a href="#footnote177b">{177b}</a>

youth, the freshness of his form was stained with blood,<br />His accoutrements
resounded, his chargers made a clang; <a name="citation177d"></a><a href="#footnote177d">{177d}</a><br />His
cheeks <a name="citation177e"></a><a href="#footnote177e">{177e}</a>

desolation in the toil;<br />In the first onset his lances penetrate
the targets, <a name="citation177f"></a><a href="#footnote177f">{177f}</a><br />And
a track of surrounding light is made by the aim of the darting of his
spears.</p>

accustomed to armies,<br />High minded, bitter handed leader of the
forces; <a name="citation179e"></a><a href="#footnote179e">{179e}</a><br />He

with a clang the sock <a name="citation180f"></a><a href="#footnote180f">{180f}</a>
descends upon the pate;<br />A successful warrior was Fflamddwr <a name="citation180g"></a><a href="#footnote180g">{180g}</a>

<p>He supported martial steeds and harness of war;<br />Drenched with
gore, on the red-stained field of Cattraeth,<br />The foremost shaft

of Heiddyn, <a name="citation181e"></a><a href="#footnote181e">{181e}</a>
the ironclad chief.</p>

weep,<br />From the raging flame of Eiddyn <a name="citation182b"></a><a href="#footnote182b">{182b}</a>
turned not aside; <a name="citation182c"></a><a href="#footnote182c">{182c}</a><br />He
stationed men of firmness in command, <a name="citation182d"></a><a href="#footnote182d">{182d}</a><br />And
the thick covering guard <a name="citation182e"></a><a href="#footnote182e">{182e}</a>
he placed in the van,<br />And vigorously he descended upon the scattered
foe;<br />In that he had revelled, he likewise sustained the main weight;<br />Of
the retinue of Mynyddawg, none escaped,<br />Save one man by slow steps,
thoroughly weakened, and tottering every way. <a name="citation182f"></a><a href="#footnote182f">{182f}</a></p>
<p>LXXIX.</p>
<p>Having sustained a loss, <a name="citation182g"></a><a href="#footnote182g">{182g}</a>
Moried bore no shield,<br />But traversed the strand <a name="citation183a"></a><a href="#footnote183a">{183a}</a>
to set the ground on fire;<br />Firmly he grasped in his hand a blue
blade,<br />And a shaft ponderous as the chief priest&rsquo;s <a name="citation183b"></a><a href="#footnote183b">{183b}</a>
crozier;<br />He rode a grey stately <a name="citation183c"></a><a href="#footnote183c">{183c}</a>
headed charger,<br />And beneath his blade there was a dreadful fall
of slaughter;<br />When overpowered <a name="citation183d"></a><a href="#footnote183d">{183d}</a>
he fled not from the battle,&mdash;<br />Even he who poured out to us
the famous mead, that sweet ensnarer.</p>
<p>LXXX.</p>
<p>I beheld the array from the highland of Adowyn, <a name="citation183e"></a><a href="#footnote183e">{183e}</a><br />And
the sacrifice brought down to the omen fire; <a name="citation183f"></a><a href="#footnote183f">{183f}</a><br />I
saw what was usual, a continual running towards the town, <a name="citation184a"></a><a href="#footnote184a">{184a}</a><br />And
the men of Nwython inflicting sharp wounds;<br />I saw warriors in complete
order approaching with a shout,<br />And the head of Dyvnwal Vrych <a name="citation184b"></a><a href="#footnote184b">{184b}</a>
by ravens <a name="citation184c"></a><a href="#footnote184c">{184c}</a>
devoured.</p>

<p>Blessed Conqueror, of temper mild, the strength <a name="citation184d"></a><a href="#footnote184d">{184d}</a>
of his people,<br />With his blue streamers displayed towards the sea-roving
foes. <a name="citation185a"></a><a href="#footnote185a">{185a}</a><br />Brave
is he on the waters, most numerous his host;<br />Manly his bosom, loud
his shout in the charge of arms.<br />Usual was it for him <a name="citation185b"></a><a href="#footnote185b">{185b}</a>
to make a descent before nine armaments, <a name="citation185c"></a><a href="#footnote185c">{185c}</a><br />With
propulsive strokes, <a name="citation185d"></a><a href="#footnote185d">{185d}</a>
in the face of blood and of the country.<br />I love thy victorious
throne, which teemed with harmonious strains.<br />O Cynddilig of Aeron,

whelp.</p>
<p>LXXXII.</p>
<p>I could wish to have been the first to shed my blood in Cattraeth,<br />As
the price <a name="citation186a"></a><a href="#footnote186a">{186a}</a>
of the mead and beverage of wine in the hall;<br />I could wish to have
been hurt by the blade of the sword,<br />Ere he was slain on the green
plain of Uphin. <a name="citation186b"></a><a href="#footnote186b">{186b}</a><br />I
loved the son of renown, who sustained the bloody fight, <a name="citation186c"></a><a href="#footnote186c">{186c}</a><br />And
made his sword descend upon the violent.<br />Can a tale of valour be
related before Gododin,<br />In which the son of Ceidiaw <a name="citation186d"></a><a href="#footnote186d">{186d}</a>
has not his fame as a man of war?</p>
<p>LXXXIII.</p>
<p>Sad it is for me, after all our toil,<br />To suffer the pang of
death through indiscretion;<br />And doubly grievous and sad for me
to see<br />Our men falling headlong to the ground, <a name="citation187a"></a><a href="#footnote187a">{187a}</a><br />Breathing
the lengthened sigh, and covered with reproaches.<br />After the strenuous
warriors have extended their country&rsquo;s bounds,<br />Rhuvawn <a name="citation187b"></a><a href="#footnote187b">{187b}</a>
and Gwgawn, <a name="citation187c"></a><a href="#footnote187c">{187c}</a>

souls, now that their conflict is ended, <a name="citation187e"></a><a href="#footnote187e">{187e}</a><br />Be
received into the heavenly region, the abode of tranquillity.</p>
<p>LXXXIV.</p>
<p>Tres repelled the foe through <a name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a">{188a}</a>
a pool of gore,<br />And slaughtered like a hero such as asked no quarter,
<a name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b">{188b}</a><br />With
a sling and a spear; <a name="citation188c"></a><a href="#footnote188c">{188c}</a>&mdash;he
flung off his glass goblet<br />Containing the mead, <a name="citation188d"></a><a href="#footnote188d">{188d}</a>
and in defence of his sovereignty overthrew an army;<br />His counsel
always prevailed, and the multitude would not speak before him, <a name="citation188e"></a><a href="#footnote188e">{188e}</a><br />Whilst
those that were cowards were not left alive,<br />Before the onset of
his battle-axes, <a name="citation188f"></a><a href="#footnote188f">{188f}</a>
and his sharpened sword, <a name="citation188g"></a><a href="#footnote188g">{188g}</a><br />And
where his blue banner was seen to wave. <a name="citation188h"></a><a href="#footnote188h">{188h}</a></p>
<p>LXXXV.</p>
<p>There was a reinforcement of <a name="citation189a"></a><a href="#footnote189a">{189a}</a>
troops,<br />A supply of penetrating weapons,<br />And a host of men
in the vanguard,<br />Presenting a menacing front;<br />In the days
of strenuous exertion,<br />In the eager conflict,<br />They displayed
their valour.<br />After the intoxication,<br />When they drank the
mead,<br />Not one was spared.<br />Though Gorwylam<br />Was awhile
successful,<br />When the retort was made, it broke the charge<br />Of
the horses and men, by fate decreed.</p>

arrives,<br />I anxiously count <a name="citation190a"></a><a href="#footnote190a">{190a}</a>

flight <a name="citation190b"></a><a href="#footnote190b">{190b}</a><br />Along
the road of lamentation.<br />Affectionately have I deplored, <a name="citation190c"></a><a href="#footnote190c">{190c}</a><br />Dearly
have I loved,<br />The illustrious dweller of the wood, <a name="citation190d"></a><a href="#footnote190d">{190d}</a><br />And
the men of Argoed, <a name="citation190e"></a><a href="#footnote190e">{190e}</a><br />Accustomed,

boards,<br />Midst a deluge of grief,<br />The viands for the banquet,<br />Where
they caroused together;&mdash;he conducted us to a bright <a name="citation191d"></a><a href="#footnote191d">{191d}</a>
fire,<br />And to a carpet of white and fresh <a name="citation191e"></a><a href="#footnote191e">{191e}</a>

<p>LXXXVII.</p>
<p>Geraint, <a name="citation191f"></a><a href="#footnote191f">{191f}</a>
from the South, did raise a shout,<br />And on the white water <a name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a">{192a}</a>
was his buckler pierced. <a name="citation192b"></a><a href="#footnote192b">{192b}</a><br />Lord
of the spear, a gentle lord!<br />The praise of mountain and sea<br />Will

from the scene of action <a name="citation192d"></a><a href="#footnote192d">{192d}</a>
cannot be restrained.<br />Unflinching eagle <a name="citation192e"></a><a href="#footnote192e">{192e}</a>

zeal;<br />The fleetest coursers he outstripped in war,<br />But was
quite a lamb <a name="citation193a"></a><a href="#footnote193a">{193a}</a>
when the wine from the goblet flowed.<br />Ere he reached the grassy
tomb, and his cheeks became pale in death, <a name="citation193b"></a><a href="#footnote193b">{193b}</a><br />He
presided over the banquet of mead, and honoured it with the generous
horn. <a name="citation193c"></a><a href="#footnote193c">{193c}</a></p>

a fettering valour he displayed; <a name="citation193f"></a><a href="#footnote193f">{193f}</a><br />The

challenged, <a name="citation194d"></a><a href="#footnote194d">{194d}</a>
and were crushed<br />By the warlike steeds with gory trappings.<br />His
martial nobles <a name="citation194e"></a><a href="#footnote194e">{194e}</a>
formed a firm array,<br />And the field was reddened, when he was greatly
affronted;<br />Severe in the conflict, with blades he slaughtered,<br />And
sad news <a name="citation194f"></a><a href="#footnote194f">{194f}</a>
from the war he brought,<br />Which he wove <a name="citation195a"></a><a href="#footnote195a">{195a}</a>

when the youth thus possessed the properties of a king, <a name="citation195e"></a><a href="#footnote195e">{195e}</a><br />He,
stained with blood, brought deliverance to Gwynedd,<br />Ere the turf
was laid upon the gentle face<br />Of the generous dead; but now undisturbed<br />In

word <i>oed</i> being taken as a verb (oedd) rather than as a substantive;
though it ought to be remarked, as indicative of the sense in which
it was regarded by the copyist, that MS. No. 3, which has generally
supplied the <i>dd</i> where it was considered necessary, has it not
in the present instance.</p>

Al. charger, in the singular number.&nbsp; The favourite steed of our
hero, supposing him to be the son of Urien Rheged, is, in the Triads,
called &ldquo;Carnavlawg&rdquo; (cloven-hoofed) and is said to have
been &ldquo;one of the three horses of depredation of the Isle of Britain,&rdquo;
(Myv. Arch. vol. ii. page 20.)&nbsp; Taliesin in his Elegy on Owain
son of Urien, describes him as</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwr gwiw uch ei amliw seirch<br />A roddei feirch<br />I eirchiaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A worthy hero seated on variegated trappings,<br />Who would give

<p><i>Thick mane</i> was regarded as one of the good points of a horse;
thus Taliesin,&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Atuyn march myngvras mangre.&rdquo;<br />Beautiful

One of the sons of Llywarch Hen is similarly represented as a youth,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wore the golden spurs,&rdquo;<br />&mdash;Owen&rsquo;s
Ll. Hen, p. 131.</p>
<p>In the days of chivalry, of which the era of the Gododin may fairly
be considered as the commencement, the privilege of decorating arms,
and the accoutrements of horses with gold, was exclusively confined
to knights, and their families; squires being only permitted the use
of silver for the purpose.&nbsp; (St. Palaye, 1. 247, 284.)</p>

&ldquo;Argyvrein,&rdquo; might perhaps come from <i>argyvrau</i>, paraphernalia;

<p>Beware of taking to thyself a wife for the sake of her portion.<br />(Cato
Gymraeg.)</p>
<p>In that case, the passage should be rendered,&mdash;</p>
<p>Ere thou didst obtain thy nuptial dowry;</p>
<p>which reading would be supported by the allusion to the nuptial feast
in the preceding passage.&nbsp; Nevertheless the term &ldquo;argynrein,&rdquo;
occurring in three other copies, would certainly point to the signification
given in the text; &ldquo;argyvrein&rdquo; being capable of the same
meaning, whilst &ldquo;argynrein&rdquo; has no reference whatever to
the nuptial dowry.</p>
<p><a name="footnote81a"></a><a href="#citation81a">{81a}</a>&nbsp;
The manner in which the person here commemorated is associated with
the ravens, leads us to suspect that he was none other than Owain ab
Urien, who is traditionally reported to have had an army of ravens in
his service, by which, however, we are probably to understand an army
of men with those birds emblazoned on their standard, even as his descendants
still bear them in their coats of arms.&nbsp; Not only do the Welsh
Romances and Bards of the middle ages allude to these ravens, but even
Taliesin and Llywarch Hen, seem pointedly to connect them with Urien
or his son.&nbsp; Thus the former in an Ode on the battle of Argoed
Llwyvaen, (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 53) in which Owain commanded the Cumbrian
forces, under his father against Ida, says,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rhag gwaith Argoed Llwyfain<br />Bu llawer celain<br />Rhuddei
frain rhag rhyfel gwyr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of the battle of Argoed Llwyvain,<br />There happened many
a dead carcase,<br />And the ravens were coloured with the war of men.</p>
<p>And Llywarch Hen in his &ldquo;Elegy on Urien Rheged&rdquo; has the
following expressions;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pen a borthav ar vy nhu; Pen Urien,<br />Llary, llyw ei lu;<br />Ac
ar ei vron wen vran ddu.</p>
<p>Pen a borthav mywn vy nghrys; pen Urien,<br />Llary llywiai lys:<br />Ac
ar ei vron wen vran ai hys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bear by my side a head; the head of Urien,<br />The mild leader
of his army;<br />And on his white bosom the sable raven is perched.</p>
<p>I bear in my shirt a head; the head of Urien,<br />That governed
a court with mildness;<br />And on his white bosom the sable raven doth
glut.<br />(Owen&rsquo;s Ll. Hen. p. 24.)</p>
<p>This supposition would considerably enhance the point and beauty
of the passage in the text; for a sad or unbecoming thing, indeed, (&ldquo;cwl,&rdquo;
<i>a fault</i>) would it be that one who fought by the aid of ravens
should himself be eventually devoured by them.</p>
<p>Moreover, a tradition prevails, that Owain the son of Urien was actually
engaged in the battle of Cattraeth.&nbsp; Thus Lewis Glyn Cothi, a poet
of the fifteenth century, observes;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bwriodd Owain ab Urien<br />Y tri thwr yn Nghattraeth hen.<br />Ovnodd
Arthur val goddaith<br />Owain, ei vrain a&rsquo;i fon vraith.&rdquo;<br />(I.
140.)</p>
<p>Owain son of Urien overthrew<br />The three towers of Cattraeth of
old;<br />Arthur dreaded, as the flames,<br />Owain, his ravens, and
his parti-coloured staff.</p>
<p>But to the view which would identify our hero with the son of Urien
there is this objection, that the poem describes the former as the son
of Marro or Marco; nor can the difficulty be got over, without supposing
that this was another name of Urien.&nbsp; Or if that be inadmissible,
the line, in which Owain&rsquo;s name occurs, may be translated,&mdash;</p>
<p>Alas, the beloved friend of Owain;</p>
<p>an alteration, which will do no great violence to the allusion about
the ravens.</p>

Al. &ldquo;March,&rdquo; as if addressing the horse of the slain;&mdash;</p>

&ldquo;Cynhaiawc,&rdquo; (cyn-taiawg.)&nbsp; Adopting this version for
the sake of variety, and under the impression that all the different
readings of this poem are not the mere result of orthographical accident,
but that the forms of obscure or illegible words were sometimes determined
by tradition, we must believe that the <i>taiogion</i>, who composed
the army of Madog, were simply his own tenants or dependants.</p>
<p><a name="footnote83a"></a><a href="#citation83a">{83a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Diffun,&rdquo; (di-ffun.)&nbsp; <i>Ffun</i> is any thing united
together, and is used at line 803 for a band of men.&nbsp; Some read
&ldquo;diffyn,&rdquo; (protection or defence) and in that case the sense
of the passage would seem to be,</p>
<p>He brought protection to women, and mead he distributed.</p>
<p>The former reading is preferred, inasmuch as it exhibits in a more
natural and consistent manner the twofold character of Madog, as a soldier
and a courtier, which appears to be the object of the Bard to delineate.&nbsp;
Our inference on this point is moreover supported by more obvious passages
of that description, which occur again in the Poem, such as,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ragorei veirch racvuan<br />En trin lletvegin gwin o bann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He surpassed the fleetest steeds<br />In war, but was a tame animal
when he poured the wine from the goblet.</p>
<p>The epithet &ldquo;cynhaiawc,&rdquo; assuming it to be the proper
term, would also, by reason of its contrasting effect, considerably
enhance the value of our hero&rsquo;s domestic and social courtesy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote83b"></a><a href="#citation83b">{83b}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Twll tal y rodawr.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Owen Pughe translates this
&ldquo;the front opening of his chariot;&rdquo; &ldquo;twll ar ysgwyd,&rdquo;
however, in the lxxxvii stanza, evidently refers to a shield, and this
sense is, moreover, supported by &ldquo;tyllant tal ysgwydawr,&rdquo;
in Taliesin&rsquo;s Ode on Gwallawg, as well as &ldquo;rac twll y gylchwy,&rdquo;
used by Cynddelw.&nbsp; The meaning therefore appears to be that wherever
the battle raged, there would the chief be found, so boldly and <i>directly</i>
fighting as to have the very boss of his shield perforated by the spears
of his enemy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote83c"></a><a href="#citation83c">{83c}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brwyn.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the practice which the Welsh Bards commonly
had of adapting their descriptive similes to the names, armorial bearings,
or some other peculiarities of their heroes, we may infer that the chieftain,
who is celebrated in this stanza, is none other than Madog ab Brwyn.&nbsp;
Indeed one copy reads &ldquo;mab brwyn,&rdquo; the son of Brwyn, rather
than <i>mal</i> brwyn, as above.&nbsp; He is distinguished in the Triads
with Ceugant Beilliog and Rhuvon, under the appellation of the &ldquo;three
golden corpses,&rdquo; because their weight in gold was given by their
families to have their bodies delivered up by the enemy.&nbsp; (Myv.
Arch. vol. ii. p. 69.)&nbsp; Madog ab Brwyn was the grandson of Cunedda
Wledig, lord of Gododin.</p>

expression occurs in Llywarch Hen&rsquo;s Poems with reference to Urien
Rheged, viz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oedd cledyr cywlad rhwydd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>which W. Owen has translated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the prompt defender of his neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eagle was probably the armorial badge of the hero of this stanza.</p>

Al. &ldquo;y lyr,&rdquo; to our shore.&nbsp; We have here an instance
of the kindred signification of some of the different readings found
in the Poem.&nbsp; Both words are used in juxtaposition in the following
extracts;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwelais ar vorwyn&mdash;<br />Lliw golau tonau taenverw gwenyg<br />Llanw
<i>ebyr</i> ar <i>llyr</i>, lle ni mawr-drig.&rdquo;<br />(Cynddelw.)</p>
<p>I beheld on a maiden<br />The bright hue of the spreading ebullition
of the breakers of the waves,<br />Of the flood of the effluxes of rivers,
on the strand, where it tarries not long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oedd ei var&mdash;<br />Megys twrv <i>ebyr</i> yn <i>llyr</i>

<p>His rage<br />Was like the tumult of the mouths of rivers with a
full margin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calan hyddvrev, tymp dydd yn edwi,<br />Cynhwrv yn <i>ebyr</i>,
<i>llyr</i> yn llenwi.&rdquo;<br />(Ll P. Moch.)</p>
<p>The beginning of October, the period of the falling off of day,<br />There
is tumult in the mouths of rivers, filling up the shore.</p>
<p><a name="footnote85a"></a><a href="#citation85a">{85a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ammod.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was probably a confederation entered
into by the different princes, for the purpose of uniting their forces
against the common enemy; a supposition corroborated by the word &ldquo;cywlad,&rdquo;
just used.&nbsp; The poet might, however, have intended a play upon
the word &ldquo;ammod,&rdquo; because of its great resemblance in sound
to &ldquo;ammwyd,&rdquo; a <i>bait</i>, to which the eagle was allured,
&ldquo;llithywyt&rdquo; (llithiwyd) a strictly sporting term.</p>
<p><a name="footnote85b"></a><a href="#citation85b">{85b}</a>&nbsp;

We have adopted &ldquo;Manawyd&rdquo; as a proper name, under the impression
that the different stanzas of the Gododin, albeit regular links of the
same general subject, are nevertheless in a manner each complete in
itself, and therefore that it would be more natural, where the drift
of the paragraph allowed, or seemed to have that tendency, to look out
for the names of the chiefs, who may be thus distinctly introduced;
according to the tenor of the following declaration which is appended
to &ldquo;Gorchan Cynvelyn.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. vol. i. page 61.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canu un Canuauc a dal pob Awdyl o&rsquo;r Gododin heruyd breint
yngcerd amrysson.&nbsp; Tri chanu a thriugeint a thrychant a dal pob
un or Gorchaneu . . . Achaws yu am goffau yn y Gorchaneu rivedi Guyr
a aethant y Gatraeth nog y dyle gur vyned i ymlad heb arveu; Ny dyle
Bard myned i amrysson heb y gerd honno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every Ode of the Gododin is equivalent to a single song, according
to the privilege of poetical competition.&nbsp; Each of the incantations
is equal to three hundred and sixty-three songs, because the number
of the men who went to Cattraeth is commemorated in the Incantations,
and as no man should go to battle without arms, so no Bard ought to
contend without that Poem.</p>
<p>It is true that in the Vellum MS. as transcribed by Davies, this
does not form a distinct stanza, but is a continuation of the preceding
one.&nbsp; Nevertheless in other copies a detached position is given
to it, which seems required also by the opening sentence, and particularly
by the rhyme.</p>
<p>We find, moreover, that Manawyd was anciently used as a proper name,
for not to mention Manawydan and Culvynawyd, we have Manawyd in one
of Taliesin&rsquo;s Poems as undoubtedly the name of a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ys gwyr Manawyd a Phryderi.&rdquo;<br />(Myv. Arch. vol. i.
p. 67.)</p>
<p>The name of Pryderi occurs further on in our Poem.</p>
<p>Manawyd is mentioned likewise in the Dialogue between Arthur, Cai,
and Glewlwyd,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neus duc Manavid eis tull o Trywrid&rdquo;<br />(Myv. Arch.
vol. i. p. 167.)</p>
<p>Dr. O. Pughe translates the line in the Gododin thus &mdash;</p>

One reason for not regarding &ldquo;Caeawc&rdquo; as a proper name,
may be discovered in the manner in which the expression &ldquo;cawawc
cynhorawc&rdquo; is used in an anonymous poem of an early date, apud
Myv. Arch. vol. i. page 180.&nbsp; The author, though he evidently borrowed
it from the Gododin, as indeed his allusion to Cattraeth a few lines
before would likewise imply, employs it merely as an epithet.</p>
<p><a name="footnote87b"></a><a href="#citation87b">{87b}</a>&nbsp;

gives &ldquo;bled e maran,&rdquo; on the open strand.</p>

&ldquo;This singular fact of the ancient Britons wearing amber beads,
is confirmed by many beads of amber having been found in the barrows
on Salisbury plain, which have been recently dug.&nbsp; I understand
that in several of these graves, pieces of amber like beads have been
met with; and in one as many beads were found as would have made a wreath.&rdquo;&nbsp;

The hero of this stanza we take to be the &ldquo;son of Ysgyran&rdquo;
himself.&nbsp; He disdained the eager advance of the enemy; for such
was his will, that he had only to declare it, to make Venedotia and
the North acknowledge his power, and submit to his jurisdiction; or,
it may be, to march unanimously to his side.&nbsp; Supposing &ldquo;gwyar,&rdquo;
however, to be the correct reading, we might render the line thus,&mdash;</p>
<p>He repelled violence, and gore trickled to the ground.</p>
<p>Perhaps the identity of the person commemorated with the son of Ysgyran
would become more evident by the addition of a comma after &ldquo;gyssul,&rdquo;
thus,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ket dyffei wyned a gogled e rann<br />O gussyl,&mdash; mah

<p>Who Ysgyran, or Cyran (the <i>ys</i> being a mere prefix) was, we

Deivyr and Bryneich, (<i>Deira and Bernicia</i>) are situated on the
eastern coast of the island, the river Humber, as we learn from the
Triads, (Myv. Arch. vol. ii. p. 68) flowing through a portion thereof.&nbsp;
In a document which has been published in the Iolo MSS. Argoed Derwennydd,
(Derwent wood probably) and the river Trenn or Trent, are mentioned
as the extreme boundaries of the region.&nbsp; The triads moreover speak
of the three sons of Dysgyvedawg, (or Dysgyvyndawd) viz. Gall, Difedel,
and Ysgavnell, under the appellation of the &ldquo;three monarchs of
Deivyr and Bryneich,&rdquo; (Ibid. p. 64) about the period, as it would
appear, of our Poem.</p>
<p>It is clear from the above passage in the Gododin, as well as from
those lines, (78, 79.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ar deulu brenneych beych barnasswn<br />Dilyw dyn en vyw nys
adawsswn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I had judged you to be of the tribe of Bryneich,<br />Not the
phantom of a man would I have left alive;</p>
<p>that the people of those countries were not at the time in question
on friendly terms with the neighbouring Britons; which circumstance
is further apparent from the contemporary testimony of Llywarch Hen,
who speaks of Urien as having conquered the land of Bryneich;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neus gorug o dir Brynaich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, it is true, might have a reference to the Saxon tribes, who
had succeeded at an early period, in establishing themselves along the
coast in that part of the island, yet the disparaging manner in which
the grave of Disgyrnin Disgyfedawt, evidently the father of the &ldquo;three
monarchs,&rdquo; is spoken of in the Englynion y Beddau, inclines us
strongly to the belief that it was the Aborigines themselves who were
thus guilty of treason to the common weal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cigleu don drom dra thywawd,<br />Am vedd Dysgyrnyn Dysgyveddawd,<br />Aches
trwm angwres pechawd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hear the sullen wave beyond the strand,<br />Round the grave of Dysgyrnyn
Dysgyveddawd,<br />Heavy the burning impulse raised by sin.<br />(Myv.

<p><a name="footnote90e"></a><a href="#citation90e">{90e}</a>&nbsp;
Hyveidd Hir was the son of Bleiddan Sant, of Glamorgan, (the celebrated
Lupus.)&nbsp; According to the Triads he was one of the three alien
kings, upon whom dominion was conferred for their mighty deeds, and
for their praiseworthy and gracious qualities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri eilldeyrn ynys Prydain: Gwrgai vab Gwrien yn y Gogledd,
a Chadavael vab Cynvedw yng Ngwynedd, a Hyveidd Hir vab Bleiddan Sant
ym Morganwg: sev y rhodded Teyrnedd iddynt am eu campau a&rsquo;u cynneddvau
clodvorion a rhadvorion.&rdquo;<br />(Triad, 26, third series.)</p>
<p>Taliesin, in his Ode to Urien, speaks of Hyveidd in conjunction with
Gododin;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyveidd a Gododin a lleu towys.&rdquo;<br />(Myv. Arch. vol.
i. p. 57.)</p>
<p>His name also occurs in another poem, by the same Bard, &ldquo;to
Gwallawg ap Lleenawg;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haearnddur a Hyfeidd a Gwallawg<br />Ac Owein Mon Maelgynig
ddefawd<br />A wnaw peithwyr gorweiddiawg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haearnddur and Hyveidd and Gwallawg,<br />And Owain of Mon, of Maelgynian
manner,<br />Would prostrate the ravagers.<br />(Myv. Arch. vol. i.
p. 64.)</p>
<p>The epithet &ldquo;Hir,&rdquo; (<i>long</i> or <i>tall</i>) applied
to Hyveidd, countenances the view of his being conspicuous on account
of his size.</p>
<p><a name="footnote91a"></a><a href="#citation91a">{91a}</a>&nbsp;
Gognaw must have been the son of Botgad.&nbsp; The name, as well as
that of the preceding hero, occurs in an Ode which Taliesin addressed
to Gwallawg ab Lleenawg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gognaw ei brawd digones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, however, it be not a proper name in this stanza, it may be rendered
either &ldquo;with laughter and sprightliness,&rdquo; or &ldquo;they
were a laughing energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote91b"></a><a href="#citation91b">{91b}</a>&nbsp;
Al. &ldquo;As with blades they dealt mutual blows.&rdquo;</p>

Al. &ldquo;a allaw,&rdquo; <i>who is able</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote92a"></a><a href="#citation92a">{92a}</a>&nbsp;
The same consideration which induced us to regard &ldquo;Manawyd&rdquo;
as a proper name in a former stanza, has caused us to leave &ldquo;Gwanar&rdquo;
untranslated in this place.&nbsp; It is not improbable, however, from
the shortness of this sonnet, that the line containing the name of its
hero may have been lost.&nbsp; In that case we should translate &ldquo;chwerthin
wanar,&rdquo; &ldquo;their leader laughed.&rdquo;&nbsp; That Gwanar
was occasionally used as a proper name by the ancient Britons, appears
from Triad xl. (first series) where we find one of the sons of Lliaws
ab Nwyvre so called.&nbsp; He flourished however before the date of
the Gododin, and cannot on that account be identified with the Gwanar
of the text.&nbsp; Taliesin uses the word in his &ldquo;Mic Dinbych,&rdquo;
apparently as a proper name;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clod wasgar a Gwanar ydd ymddullyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote92b"></a><a href="#citation92b">{92b}</a>&nbsp;

The Bard in the two last lines seems to be addressing Death, or Fate,
which he designates as &ldquo;the strong pillar of the living law,&rdquo;
or the law of nature, just as the Latins called it &ldquo;dura necessitas,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mortis dura lex,&rdquo; &ldquo;fatalis Parcarum lex,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp;
The expressions &ldquo;heb vawr drydar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arwar,&rdquo;
indicative of the effects of death, are introduced by way of contrast
to the noisy mirth which characterised the warriors&rsquo; march to
the field of battle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Arwar&rdquo; signifies literally a
<i>quiescent state</i>, or <i>state of general rest</i>; <i>pacification</i>;
and as such is a very proper term to denote the character of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O <i>arwar</i> daiar down i gyd dyddbrawd.&rdquo;<br />(Ll.
P. Moch.)</p>
<p>From the silent state of earth we shall all come at the judgment
day.</p>

As the word &ldquo;glas,&rdquo; though primarily signifying <i>blue</i>,
has also a very general sense, and may mean merely <i>pale</i> or <i>fresh</i>,
yet as we find decided colours attributed to mead elsewhere in the poem,
such as &ldquo;melyn,&rdquo; (yellow) and &ldquo;gwyn&rdquo; (white)
we have thought proper to retain the literal acceptation in this place,
as a poetical variety, however inapplicable to the beverage in question
it may seem.</p>
<p><a name="footnote93b"></a><a href="#citation93b">{93b}</a>&nbsp;

The name of the chieftain, who commanded this particular troop, is not
mentioned, unless (which is not very probable) we take &ldquo;Trychant&rdquo;
in the third line as a proper name, and translate thus,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo; Trychant marshals his men, armed with the weapons of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, are we to understand by &ldquo;trwy beiryant,&rdquo; that he
marshalled his men by means of some instrument or machinery?</p>

vigorous order.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote94b"></a><a href="#citation94b">{94b}</a>&nbsp;
The followers of the son of Cian (<i>a little dog</i>) are evidently
called &ldquo;aergwn,&rdquo; (<i>dogs of war</i>) in allusion to his
patronymic, as well as to the name of his residence, &ldquo;maen gwyngwn,&rdquo;
(<i>the stone of the white dogs</i>.)&nbsp; Probably also the figure
of a dog was charged on their banner.</p>
<p><a name="footnote94c"></a><a href="#citation94c">{94c}</a>&nbsp;
The Bernicians, as we have already noticed, were at this time opposed
to the British patriots.&nbsp; The Cymry carried a traditional hatred
of that people with them into Wales, and applied the term <i>Bryneich</i>
to such of their kindred as allied themselves to the enemies of their
country, as is abundantly manifest in the works of the medi&aelig;val
Bards.&mdash;See STEPHEN&rsquo;S Literature of the Kymry, p. 265.)</p>

Or, &ldquo;Like a deluge, I would not have left a man alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote94e"></a><a href="#citation94e">{94e}</a>&nbsp;
It is very probable that the son of Cian had married a daughter of one
of the chiefs of Bryneich, which would thus account for the Bard&rsquo;s
lurking apprehension at first, that he might be induced to barter his
allegiance for the dowry to be expected with his wife.&nbsp; His fears
however were groundless; for such were the purity and patriotism of
our youthful hero, that he even refused the dowry when it was offered
to him, and braved his father-in-law&rsquo;s anger withal.</p>
<p><a name="footnote95a"></a><a href="#citation95a">{95a}</a>&nbsp;
In Gorchan Maelderw we read of&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only son of Cian from Trabannawg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cian was a Bard, and is mentioned as such by Nennius in the following
passage,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Item Talhaern Talanguen in Poemate claruit, et Nuevin et Taliessin,
et Bluchbar, et Cian qui vocatur Gueinchguant (<i>Cian who is called
Gwyngwn</i>) simul uno tempore in poemate Britannico claruerunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taliesin likewise represents him in that character in a Poem entitled,
&ldquo;Angar Cyvyndawd.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 34.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cian pan ddarvu<br />Lliaws gyvolu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Cian sang the praise of many.</p>
<p>The circumstance of his being thus a poet, and classed with Aneurin
(Nuevin) would account for the intimacy which subsisted between the
latter and his son.</p>
<p>Cian is said to have been the servant of Peris, and to them conjointly
is Llangian in Caernarvonshire dedicated.&nbsp; Cian is commemorated
on the 11th of December.&mdash;See Rees&rsquo;s Welsh Saints, p. 302.</p>
<p><a name="footnote95b"></a><a href="#citation95b">{95b}</a>&nbsp;
It is probable that <i>three hundred</i> was the number which composed
the retinue of Mynyddawg, and that a <i>hundred thousand</i>, a large
round figure, is chosen to denote the preponderance of the enemy&rsquo;s
forces that were arrayed in opposition.&nbsp; This view seems more in
unison with reason, as well as with the grammatical construction of
the passage, (&ldquo;emdaflawr&rdquo; being a middle verb) than the
supposition that the &ldquo;milcant a thrychant&rdquo; formed the total
of the army of the Cymry.</p>

with his original place of residence, or at any rate may be considered
as being situate within the limits of his ancient dominions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
retinue of Mynyddawg Eiddin at Cattraeth&rdquo; is represented as one
of &ldquo;the three honourable retinues of the Isle of Britain,&rdquo;
because the men who composed it had joined their chieftain&rsquo;s standard
of their own accord, and marched at their own expense, claiming neither
pay nor reward for their service, from king or country.</p>

These plumes must accordingly have been themselves red.&nbsp; That military
men at this period did wear feathers of particular colours as distinctive
badges, is further evident from the testimony of Llywarch Hen, who describes
himself as having worn &ldquo;yellow plumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwedy meirch hywedd, a chochwedd ddillad,<br />A phluawr melyn,<br />Main

Mr. Davies and Dr. Pughe seem to have preferred the expression &ldquo;<i>pedryolet</i>
bennawr,&rdquo; which they construed into <i>four pointed helmets</i>:
&ldquo;pedryollt,&rdquo; <i>split into four parts</i>, would appear,
however, to be much more accordant with the descriptive tenor of the
passage.</p>
<p><a name="footnote97d"></a><a href="#citation97d">{97d}</a>&nbsp;
As in the two preceding lines is contained a compliment to military
valour, the evident drift of the poem requires that it should be applied
to the British party; hence &ldquo;rac&rdquo; in this place must be
understood to mean that the toiling warriors were <i>from</i> or <i>of</i>
the retinue of Mynyddawg rather than from those who confronted him.</p>

seem to be, that the men, having marched to the field of battle at dawn,

between tide and tide being equal to the length of a day.</p>

It is clear from this statement that Erthai was the lawful lord of the
Mordei.&nbsp; He had been deprived of his dominions for a time, probably
through the usurpation of the &ldquo;steel-clad commander,&rdquo; but
at length succeeded in recovering them.&nbsp; Who Erthai was we know
not; Llywarch Hen had a son, whose name bore some resemblance to the
word: he is mentioned in the following triplet;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best three men in their country,<br />For protecting their
habitation,<br />Eithyr and <i>Erthyr</i> and Argad.&rdquo;<br />(Elegy
on Old Age.)</p>

Al. &ldquo;Erthgi,&rdquo; which is obviously the same as &ldquo;Arthgi,&rdquo;
a <i>bear-dog</i>.&nbsp; The rhythmical run of the line seems, however,
to point to the other as the proper word.</p>
<p><a name="footnote102b"></a><a href="#citation102b">{102b}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Erthychei;&rdquo; there is here evidently an allusion to the
name of the hero, (that is, supposing the name adopted in the translation
to be the right one) which consideration induces us to prefer it to
the other reading, viz. &ldquo;erthrychei.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With
the latter word, however, we should translate the passage as follows;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the front Erthai would mangle an army.&rdquo;</p>

Probably Edeyrn may have been the hero of this stanza, and that a play
upon the word is intended in the expression &ldquo;edyrn diedyrn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Edyrn the kingdom will remain, but Edyrn the king is gone.</p>

Nudd ab Beli ab Rhun ab Maelgwn ab Caswallon Lawhir ab Einiawn Yrth

The names of both these persons, as we have already seen, occur together
in a Poem attributed to Aneurin, and printed in Davies&rsquo;s Mythology
of the Druids.&nbsp; The latter, moreover, appears in the Tale of &ldquo;Kilhwch
and Olwen,&rdquo; where a daughter of his is likewise mentioned by the
name of Eheubryd.&nbsp; Cyvwlch is there stated to have been one of
the three grandsons of Cleddyv Divwlch, the other two being Bwlch and
Sevwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their three shields are three gleaming glitterers.&nbsp;
Their three spears are three pointed piercers.&nbsp; Their three swords

<p>&ldquo;The three awful events of the <i>Isle of Britain</i>; first,
the bursting of the lake of waters, and the overwhelming of the face

It would appear from this that the feast was given in celebration of
the time of harvest.&nbsp; That the Britons, like the Jews, exhibited
signs of great joy at that season, may be inferred from the following
Triads of Dyvnwal Moelmud.&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. vol. iii. p. 283.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tair clud udcorn sydd; dygynnull gwlad gan riaint a phencenedloedd,

&ldquo;social tribe of the Isle of Britain,&rdquo; who &ldquo;came from
the land of Llydaw, and were descended from the primitive tribe of the
Cymry,&rdquo; (Triad 5, third series.)&nbsp; Being the third principal
tribe that settled in Britain, it is probable that their original inheritance
was Alban, one of the &ldquo;three principal provinces of the Isle of
Britain,&rdquo; (See Triad 2) which they must have occupied prior to
the time of Prydain the son of Aedd Mawr.&nbsp; Dunbarton is Dun Bretton,

<p>There are various readings of the word which is here translated <i>prowess</i>,

thus &ldquo;cobnet&rdquo; comes from <i>cobiaw</i>, to thump, &ldquo;colwed,&rdquo;
from <i>col</i> a sting, or a prop, whilst &ldquo;eofned&rdquo; literally
means fearlessness.</p>

on his own showing the word has no other etymon than that of &ldquo;ffos,&rdquo;

Their names are given in &ldquo;Gwarchan Cynvelyn.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Myv.

<p>Three warriors and three score and three hundred,<br />To the conflict

The grave of Cynon is thus recorded;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet gur gwaud urtin<br />In uchel titin in isel gwelitin<br />Bet

<p>The grave of a warrior of high renown<br />Is in a lofty region&mdash;but

&ldquo;Gwenwawd.&rdquo;&nbsp; It might be translated &ldquo;flattering
song,&rdquo; but <i>candid</i> or <i>sacred</i> seems more consonant
with the character of a Bard, whose motto was &ldquo;Y gwir yn erbyn

his heraldic badge, which, according to the law of nations, would immediately
cause a cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tair braint Beirdd ynys Prydain; Trwyddedogaeth lle&rsquo;r

<p>The three primary privileges of the Bards of the Isle of Britain;
maintenance wherever they go; that no naked weapon be borne in their

Thus in Gorchan Maelderw,&mdash;</p>

If we give an affirmative meaning to the words &ldquo;angkynnull agkymandull
agkysgoget,&rdquo; the couplet might be thus rendered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They assembled in arms, and in complete array they moved along,<br />And
rolled through the mighty horde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is observable that Carnhuanawc adopted this affirmative form in
a similar passage with which &ldquo;Gorchan Tudvwlch&rdquo; opens, thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arv ynghynnull,<br />Yn nghymandull,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twrv
yn agwedd;<br />Y rhag meiwedd,<br />Y rhag mawredd,<br />Y rhag madiedd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They assemble in arms,<br />The forces are marshalled,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tumult
approaches:<br />In the van are the warlike,<br />In the van are the
noble,<br />In the van are the good.</p>
<p>And he moreover traces a similarity between this style and that of
Tacitus, wherein the latter describes the effects of Galgacus&rsquo;s
address upon his British followers;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jamque agmina, et armorum fulgores, audentissimi, cujusque
procursu, simul instruebantur acies.&rdquo;<br />(See Hanes Cymru, p.

Lloegrians.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote117b"></a><a href="#citation117b">{117b}</a>&nbsp;
The Lloegrians were the second &ldquo;social tribe&rdquo; that settled
in Britain.&nbsp; Their province was that of Lloegyr, by which the Welsh
still designate England, (Triads v. ii. first series) though there is
reason to believe that it was originally of much smaller extent.&nbsp;
The Lloegrians for the most part coalesced with the Saxons, (Triad vii.
third series) and grievously harassed the Cymry in the sixth century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cynddylan, cae di y rhiw,<br />Er yddaw Lloegyrwys heddiw;<br />Amgeledd

<p><a name="footnote117d"></a><a href="#citation117d">{117d}</a>&nbsp;
This probably refers to the enemy, who, being pagans, burnt their dead.&nbsp;
The fact might have been suggested to the poet&rsquo;s mind, by the
name of his hero &ldquo;Graid,&rdquo; which signifies <i>heat</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote117e"></a><a href="#citation117e">{117e}</a>&nbsp;
Viz. that of Graid.</p>
<p><a name="footnote117f"></a><a href="#citation117f">{117f}</a>&nbsp;
The rhyme determines this form, which occurs in 1.&nbsp; In Gorchan
Maelderw, we have, instead of Graid the son of Hoewgi, &ldquo;Braint
the son of Bleiddgi.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote118a"></a><a href="#citation118a">{118a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Orwydan,&rdquo; from Gorwydd.&nbsp; Another way of translating
these lines would be&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was the hero of the two shielded wings,<br />The one
with the variegated front; the other of like quality with Prydwen;</p>
<p>which was the name of Arthur&rsquo;s shield;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tarian a gymmerai Arthur ar ei Ysgwydd, yr hon a elwid Prydwen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shield did Arthur take upon his shoulder, which was called Prydwen.<br />(Gr.
ab Arthur.)</p>
<p>The supposition that Arthur&rsquo;s shield had already acquired a
notable renown is indirectly corroborated by an alleged contemporary
poem, &ldquo;Preiddiau Annwn.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 45)
in which his ship of the same name is clearly invested with a similarly
extravagant character,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri lloneid Prydwen ydd aetham ni ar for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote118b"></a><a href="#citation118b">{118b}</a>&nbsp;

<p><a name="footnote119b"></a><a href="#citation119b">{119b}</a>&nbsp;
Perhaps buried on the field of battle, where the horses would trample
on his grave; or the expression might allude to the mode of his being
conveyed by horses to his last resting place.</p>
<p><a name="footnote119c"></a><a href="#citation119c">{119c}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eleirch,&rdquo; lit. <i>swans</i>, but the expression &ldquo;meirch
eilw eleirch,&rdquo; (horses of the colour of swans) in the Maelderw
version, seems to favour the translation we have given above.</p>
<p><a name="footnote119d"></a><a href="#citation119d">{119d}</a>&nbsp;

During the Christmas festivities, which lasted for twelve days:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Llon ceiliog a thwylluan<br />Au <i>deuddeng-nydd</i> yn hoean&rdquo;<br />&mdash;Engl.

<p>On those occasions Bards and minstrels were frequent guests at the
halls of the nobility, and their company contributed not a little to
the general entertainment.&nbsp; The air &ldquo;Nos Galan,&rdquo; we
may fairly presume, was a favourite at those festivities.</p>
<p><a name="footnote120c"></a><a href="#citation120c">{120c}</a>&nbsp;
The word &ldquo;arvaeth&rdquo; in this poem seems to have a reference
throughout to &ldquo;arwydd,&rdquo; or <i>ensign</i>.&nbsp; Thus we
may suppose that Gwenabwy bore the <i>Dragon</i> for his arms, which
device conveyed the idea of devastation, rather than that of cultivation.</p>
<p><a name="footnote120d"></a><a href="#citation120d">{120d}</a>&nbsp;
The Bard, according to his general custom, is here contrasting the two
aspects of his hero&rsquo;s character, the domestic and the martial.</p>

might be a proper name, for we find that one of &ldquo;the three free

as it would in that character appear somewhat out of place here, we
have chosen the etymological sense in preference.</p>

<p>In Llongborth I beheld a solemn pile,<br />And men suffering privation,<br />And

<p>&ldquo;Falsely was it said by Tudlew,<br />That no one&rsquo;s steeds

&ldquo;O barth deheu.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Deheu,&rdquo; literally means
<i>the right</i>, and as the mid-day sun is to the right of a person
looking eastward, the word is also taken to signify the south; hence
we say &ldquo;deheudir&rdquo; for South Wales.&nbsp; The &ldquo;parth
deheu&rdquo; in this place must accordingly mean some district south
of the scene of action, such as Wales, where Gwyddno and his family
resided, would be.</p>

If we take this &ldquo;clawdd&rdquo; to be the Catrail, we must look
for Offer and Maddeu towards the extremity most remote from head quarters,
i.e. the fort of Eiddin, (Edinburgh) and it is rather remarkable that,
whilst the Catrail is generally supposed to terminate southward at the
Peel-fell, some eminent antiquaries have fixed its furthest point at
Castle <i>Over</i>, where there is a British fort, and others have thought
that they could trace it in the <i>Maiden-way</i> near the Roman wall,
though it must be confessed that these supposed continuations are by
a third party regarded as Roman roads.&nbsp; The similarity between
the words Offer and Over is very obvious.&nbsp; Baxter identifies <i>Over</i>
with <i>Oliclavis</i>, which is naught else but <i>ol y clawdd</i> the
extremity of the rampart.</p>

Mr. Davies thinks that this warrior was the son of Cunedda, who gave
his name to Ceredigion.&nbsp; As Cunedda, however, flourished in the
early part of the fifth century, the martial age of his son Ceredig
would not well coincide with the date of this poem.&nbsp; There was
another Caredig, who succeeded Maelgwn Gwynedd as king of the Britons,
about A.D. 590.</p>

Or &ldquo;When the appointed time of his departure is at hand,&rdquo;

in other poems, where &ldquo;cyrdd&rdquo; is unmistakeably used as the
plural of &ldquo;cerdd,&rdquo; a <i>song</i>, e.g.&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyrdd a cherddorion<br />A chathleu englynion.&rdquo;</p>

to Arthur he is styled &ldquo;Pillar of Cymru.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri chadvarchawg Teyrn ynys Prydain: Caradawc Vreiehvras,

<p>Caradawg&rsquo;s horse Lluagor is recorded as one of the three battle
horses of the Island.&nbsp; (Trioedd y Meirch, Myv. Arch. vol. ii. p.
20.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote127a"></a><a href="#citation127a">{127a}</a>&nbsp;
This simile has evidently some connection with the story told of Caradawg,
that owing to his well founded confidence in his wife&rsquo;s virtue,
he was able to carve a certain Boar&rsquo;s head, an adventure in which
his compeers failed.&nbsp; It is remarkable also that the Boar&rsquo;s
head, in some form or other, appears as the armorial bearing of all
of his name.&nbsp; See the &ldquo;Dream of Rhonabwy.&rdquo;&mdash;Note.
Al. &ldquo;red boar.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote127b"></a><a href="#citation127b">{127b}</a>&nbsp;
This statement may have two meanings, the one real, as indicative of
what did actually take place, namely, that the dogs came out of the
neighbouring woods to feed upon the corpses which had fallen by the
band of Caradawg; the other allegorical, as referring to himself in
his character of a boar or a bull, the wild dogs being his enemies,
who thus hunted and baited him.</p>
<p><a name="footnote127c"></a><a href="#citation127c">{127c}</a>&nbsp;
We may infer from this admission that the Bard&rsquo;s statements, though
poetically adorned, are, as to the main facts, framed with a strict
regard to truth.&nbsp; Thus no less than four vouchers for the correctness
of his description of Caradawg&rsquo;s valour are presented to our notice
by name.</p>

Gwriad was the son of Gwrien, one of the three princes of vassal origin.&nbsp;

<p>Making &ldquo;kynn caffat&rdquo; into one word &ldquo;cynghaffad,&rdquo;

Two persons named Gwgan and Gwion occur together in a Triad, as having
been sentinels in the battle of Bangor, A.D. 603.&nbsp; As that event,
however, happened subsequently to the battle of Cattraeth, where the
heroes of the stanza were killed, the parties could not be the same.&nbsp;
There was another Gwgawn, designated Llawgadarn, who is ranked with
Gwrnerth and Eidiol in a Triad of the three strong men of Britain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri gyrddion ynys Prydain: Gwrnerth Ergydlym, a laddes yr

Rhuvawn is celebrated in a Triad as one of the three blessed kings of
the Isle of Britain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri gwyndeyrn ynys Prydain; Rhun ab Maelgwn, Owain ab Urien,
a Rhuawn Bevr ab Dewrath Wledig.&rdquo;<br />(Triad xxv. third series.)</p>
<p>In another Triad he is recorded as one of the three imperious ones
of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri trahawc ynys Prydein; Gwibei drahawc a Sawyl ben uchel
a Ruuawn Peuyr drahawc.&rdquo;<br />(Triad xxxiv. second series.)</p>
<p>Other versions, however, of the same Triad, give Rhun mab Einiawn
in the room of Rhuvawn Pebyr.</p>
<p>He is also styled one of the three golden corpses of the Isle of
Britain, because, when he was slain, his body was redeemed for its weight
in gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri eurgelein ynys Prydain: Madawc mab Brwyn; Ceugant Beilliawc;

<p>His grave is alluded to by Hywel the son of Owain Gwynedd, about
A.D. 1160, in these lines;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonn wenn orewyn a orwlych bet<br />Gwytua ruuawn bebyr ben

Rhuvawn is celebrated as pious, valiant, and hospitable.</p>
<p><a name="footnote132d"></a><a href="#citation132d">{132d}</a>&nbsp;
The hall (neuadd) might have been the camp itself, or it might have
been the general&rsquo;s tent, answering to the Roman pr&aelig;torium.&nbsp;
Along the extent of the Catrail there are several forts of the British
people, which were built either on the contiguous hills, or on the neighbouring
heights.&nbsp; A field in the neighbourhood of Dolgelley, which exhibits
clear vestiges of an ancient encampment, goes by the name of &ldquo;<i>Neuadd
Goch</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neuadd pob diddos.&rdquo;<br />Every shelter is a hall.<br />(Adage.)</p>

Or, &ldquo;so great, so immense was the slaughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
reading; &ldquo;So great, a sea of radiance was the slaughter,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mor o wawr,&rdquo; in reference to the brightness of the weapons.</p>
<p><a name="footnote133b"></a><a href="#citation133b">{133b}</a>&nbsp;
Morien Manawc is mentioned in the &ldquo;Dream of Rhonabwy&rdquo;, as
one of the counsellors of Arthur, (p. 416.)&nbsp; His grave is pointed
out in the following lines;&mdash;(Myv. Arch. vol. i. page 79.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;E Beteu ae cut gwitwal<br />Ny llesseint heb ymtial<br />Gwrien
Morien a Morial.</p>
<p>The graves that have their mounds together,<br />Are theirs, who
fell not unavenged,<br />Gwrien, Morien, and Morial.</p>
<p>His memory was much cherished by the medi&aelig;val Bards, who not
unfrequently compare their patrons to him.&nbsp; Thus Risserdyn (1290,
1340) says that Hywel ap Gruffydd had &ldquo;vreich Moryen,&rdquo; the
arm of Morien; and his contemporary Madawg Dwygraig eulogises Gruffydd
ap Madawg as being &ldquo;ail Morien,&rdquo; a second Morien.</p>
<p><a name="footnote133c"></a><a href="#citation133c">{133c}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Medut,&rdquo; from &ldquo;meddu,&rdquo; to possess, or it may
signify &ldquo;<i>drunk</i>,&rdquo; from &ldquo;meddw.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The kindling of the fire seems to have been for the purpose of annoying
the enemy.&nbsp; Perhaps the allusion to fires, which occurs so frequently
in the Poem, may, in some measure, explain the burnt and calcined features
of many of our old camps.</p>
<p><a name="footnote133d"></a><a href="#citation133d">{133d}</a>&nbsp;
Cynon was probably the general of this camp, under whom Morien fought.</p>

the line would be &ldquo;with his brass armour shattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote133g"></a><a href="#citation133g">{133g}</a>&nbsp;
I.e. the camp occupied by the enemy, as the next line clearly indicates.</p>
<p><a name="footnote134a"></a><a href="#citation134a">{134a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Noc ac escyc,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ysgog,&rdquo; to stir.&nbsp;
Al. &ldquo;Noe ac Eseye,&rdquo; as if they were the names of some Saxon
officers, who hurled the stone.&nbsp; In this case we should render
it,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noe and Eseye hurled a massive stone from the wall of the
fort,<br />And never,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>as if he were crushed beneath it.&nbsp; Adopting the former reading,
however, we must observe the point of the words &ldquo;ysgyg&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ysgogit,&rdquo; the one indicative of his undaunted courage,
the other of his motionless state in death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marw yw&mdash;<br />Nid ysgyg er meddyg mwy.&rdquo;<br />&mdash;Dr.
S. Cent.</p>

&ldquo;Yn trwm,&rdquo; as a person &ldquo;seirchiawc saphwyawc&mdash;(and
perhaps) elydnan,&rdquo; would necessarily be.&nbsp; The bundles of
combustible materials, which he also carried, would add to the weight
of his armour, and tend to retard his movements.&nbsp; Or, &ldquo;yn
trwm&rdquo; may refer to the battle, as being a <i>pressure</i>, or
a <i>sad</i> affair.</p>

<p><a name="footnote135b"></a><a href="#citation135b">{135b}</a>&nbsp;

that the enemy fled on horseback.</p>
<p><a name="footnote135c"></a><a href="#citation135c">{135c}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cylchwy,&rdquo; means a circular inclosure as well as a shield,
and in that sense it can be taken here, as showing that Morien surrounded
the camp with fire.</p>
<p><a name="footnote135d"></a><a href="#citation135d">{135d}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gwyth;&rdquo; another reading gives &ldquo;gwych,&rdquo; which
would have the same meaning as &ldquo;gowychydd,&rdquo; line 296.</p>
<p><a name="footnote135e"></a><a href="#citation135e">{135e}</a>&nbsp;
Whether we read &ldquo;ceinion&rdquo; or &ldquo;gleinion,&rdquo; we
should have the same meaning, viz.&mdash;&ldquo;of the saints,&rdquo;
the Britons being thus distinguished from the pagan Saxons.&nbsp; Thus
Llywarch Hen says of Geraint that he was</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gelyn i Sais, car i saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Saxon&rsquo;s foe, the friend of Saints.</p>
<p><a name="footnote136a"></a><a href="#citation136a">{136a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lleithig,&rdquo; a <i>throne</i>, or <i>the dais of the hall</i>;
in the latter sense it would have reference to a banquet, and perhaps
&ldquo;tal&rdquo; would mean the front or principal seat where Cynon
sat.&nbsp; When, however, the battle commenced, the chieftain quitted
the convivial board, and displayed the valour of a distinguished soldier.</p>

I.e. Elphin son of Gwyddno ab Gorvynion ab Dyvnwal Hen king of Gwent.&nbsp;
In the early part of his life he was the patron of Taliesin, whom he
found when an infant in a leathern bag, exposed on a stake of his father&rsquo;s
wear.&nbsp; &ldquo;When Elphin was afterwards imprisoned in the castle
of Dyganwy by Maelgwn Gwynedd, Taliesin by the influence of his song
procured his release.&nbsp; There is a poem in the Myvyrian Archaiology,
entitled the &ldquo;Consolation of Elphin,&rdquo; said to have been
written by the chief of Bards.</p>
<p>Or, more likely, because of his connection with the North, he was
one of the sons of Urien Rheged, mentioned by Llywarch Hen in the following
triplet,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pwylrai Wallawg, marchawg trin,<br />Er echwydd gwneuthur
dyvin,<br />Yn erbyn cyvrysedd Elphin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwallawg, the knight of tumult, would violently rave,<br />With a
mind determined to try the sharpest edge,<br />Against the conflict
of Elphin.</p>
<p><a name="footnote137a"></a><a href="#citation137a">{137a}</a>&nbsp;
Probably the Epidii, in Cantyre and Argyleshire.&nbsp; Al. &ldquo;Hud

to wiles and stratagems.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote138a"></a><a href="#citation138a">{138a}</a>&nbsp;
Morien is probably alluded to here again, whose especial department
seems to have been the superintendence of the martial fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mur
greit,&rdquo; to which we have given the same meaning as to &ldquo;Murgreit,&rdquo;
(line 292) might, however, in connection with the rest of the verse
be differently translated; thus &ldquo;The furze was kindled on the
rampart by the ardent bull of conflict,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The furze was
kindled by the ardent bulwark, the bull of conflict.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
latter construction seems to be favoured by a stanza in &ldquo;Cyvoesi
Merddin,&rdquo; (Myvyrian Archaiology, vol. i. p. 148) where Morien
is styled &ldquo;mur trin,&rdquo; &ldquo;the bulwark of conflict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marw Morgeneu marw kyvrennin<br />Marw Moryen mur trin<br />Trymmav
oed am dy adoed di Vyrdin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgeneu dead, Kyvrenin dead,<br />Morien the bulwark of conflict
dead;<br />Most sad the lingering that thou art left, O Merddin.</p>
<p><a name="footnote138b"></a><a href="#citation138b">{138b}</a>&nbsp;
The meaning seems to be, that the enemies directed their attack to the
part which abounded most with riches, or where the treasures were collected,
or it may refer to the banquet; &ldquo;alavvedd,&rdquo; signifying the
<i>flowing mead</i>.</p>

Such a treatment appears to have been offered to Gwydion, which made

Another version gives &ldquo;the birds of battle;&rdquo; but both doubtless

Or, &ldquo;of fair observation:&rdquo; probably the very individual

that Syll was an incorrect transcript of <i>pelloid</i> or <i>pellwyd</i>,

&ldquo;Dinas,&rdquo; a fortified town.&nbsp; In these lines we have
a graphic picture of the panic stricken state of that portion of the
army in which Aneurin happened to be at this particular time; and it
is a fitting prelude to the account of his incarceration which he gives
in the succeeding stanza but one.&nbsp; But whilst the bard exposes
his own incapacity, he pays an indirect compliment to the skill and
courage of Gwynwydd; such a state of affairs, he seems to say, was owing
to the absence of that hero on the heights.</p>
<p><a name="footnote144f"></a><a href="#citation144f">{144f}</a>&nbsp;
Meaning, perhaps, that had he himself been present, this cowardice would
not have been manifested.&nbsp; We may, however, render the line thus,&mdash;&ldquo;Vines

intended to illustrate the truth of the foregoing statements, viz. that
no mention would have been made of such things had they not really existed.&nbsp;

he was the son of Meirig, son of Aircol, son of Pyr, which is rather

This stanza evidently contains a reproof to one of the British chiefs,
who turned coward on the field of battle.&nbsp; The circumstances mentioned
in the two first lines, that his shield was pierced behind him, &ldquo;ar
grymal carnwyd,&rdquo; (on the crupper of his horse) would indicate
that he was then in the act of fleeing, holding his shield in such a
position, as best to protect his back from the darts of his pursuers.&nbsp;
Of this the Bard remarks &ldquo;ni mad,&rdquo; it was not honourable,

A sarcastic irony addressed to the coward himself, who probably had
boasted of some heroic deeds that he would perform.&nbsp; Where are

himself on the field of battle; not entering cities in triumph; but

&ldquo;Gell.&rdquo;&nbsp; This word has a reference to &ldquo;gell,&rdquo;

of the other; that he thought the man who appeared in dark armour would
eventually be found in a dark cellar.&nbsp; It is not clear whether
this person secreted himself, or whether he was placed by his enemies
in the &ldquo;cell&rdquo; here mentioned.&nbsp; If the former, we may
regard his eating the venison as a further proof of his unwarlike character;
if the latter, &ldquo;cnoi angell bwch&rdquo; may be considered as something
tantamount to living upon bread and water in our days.</p>

&ldquo;Dibennor;&rdquo; this word may signify either the rabble who
were not invested with military accoutrements, or such as had no regular

Eidol or Eidiol Gadarn is recorded as one of the three strong men of
Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons
with a billet of wood.</p>

<p>The time here specified &ldquo;from sunset until dark,&rdquo; will
not be found to tally at all with the commencement of the fight at Cattraeth,
which is said to have been &ldquo;with the day,&rdquo; and &ldquo;with
the dawn;&rdquo; this circumstance is fatal to Davies&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>The first lines of this stanza may be translated in divers ways,
such as,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a feast of wine and a banquet of mead, endowed<br />By
Cynlaith, mother of Hwrraith, was the energetic Eidol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a feast of wine and a banquet of mead,<br />Did his brave
(<i>hwrraith</i> from <i>hwrdd</i>) mother<br />Cynlaith, enrich<br />The
energetic Eidol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a feast of wine and a banquet of mead,<br />Did his mother
Hwrraith<br />At the first fall of the dew (<i>cyn llaith</i>) enrich<br />The
energetic Eidol.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Cynydaw&rdquo; (cnydiaw) to yield a crop.&nbsp; Cynydaw means
also to rise; and we may thus construe the passage,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foremost spearmen spring up around him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another reading gives &ldquo;cwydaw&rdquo; to fall, in allusion to
the slaughter of the men; adopting this expression, it would seem that
&ldquo;arnaw&rdquo; was more applicable to &ldquo;racvre,&rdquo; the
mount of the van.</p>
<p><a name="footnote160d"></a><a href="#citation160d">{160d}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Glas heid,&rdquo; (glas haidd) green barley.&nbsp; It is rather
singular that the words, without the slightest alteration, will admit
of another simile equally beautiful and appropriate, viz.&mdash;<i>glas
haid</i>, a blue swarm of flies.&nbsp; The word <i>glas</i> may be indicative
of the prevailing colour of the dress or armour of the men,</p>
<p>&ldquo;As from the rocky cliff the shepherd sees<br />Clustering
in heaps on heaps the driving bees,<br />Rolling, and blackening, swarms
succeeding swarms,<br />With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;<br />Dusky

<p><a name="footnote161a"></a><a href="#citation161a">{161a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hedin;&rdquo; this word seems of kindred nature with haidd (barley)
and is here translated accordingly; (hedeg, to shoot out, or to ear,
as corn.)&nbsp; Another version gives &ldquo;hediw,&rdquo; (<i>heddyw</i>,
today.)</p>

It is still very common in Wales to call the cause or origin of any
thing by the name of mam: thus, for instance, we say &ldquo;mam y drwg&rdquo;
of the chief instigator of mischief.&nbsp; What we are to understand
by the &ldquo;mother of the lance&rdquo; it is not very easy to determine;
it might have been courage or the sense of wrong, or quarrel, or any
other cause which excited the Britons to fight.</p>

<p>One who was generous of wine, and bounty, and mead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mal,&rdquo; properly speaking, seems to have been a certain
tribute, as above.&nbsp; Thus we read in Welsh legends;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave his domain of Clynog to God and to Beuno for ever,
without either contribution or tax (heb na mal nac ardreth.&rdquo;)<br />(Buch.
Beuno.)</p>

That is, free and precipitate in his course, as a ball flies through

game among the Britons called <i>pelre</i>, which consisted in the beating
of a ball backwards and forwards, and is alluded to by Taliesin in the
following lines;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ceiniadon moch clywid eu govalon:<br />Marchawglu mor daer

The Bard in this stanza evidently plays upon the names of three of the
British heroes, showing how appropriately they represented their respective
characters; <i>Cywir</i>, <i>enwir</i>; <i>Merin</i>, <i>mur</i>; <i>Madien</i>,
<i>mad</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be better to transpose the two first,
and read the line as it occurs in one stanza of the Gorchan Maelderw;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enwir ith elwir oth gywir weithred.&rdquo;<br />Enwir art

<p>for in &ldquo;Kilhwch and Olwen&rdquo; we meet with a person bearing

the presence of the army, and not for religious purposes before the
Deity.</p>

This stanza explains the expression used in line 116.&nbsp; Seven days,
then, we may suppose, formed the whole space of time during which the
events related in the Gododin occurred.&nbsp; The action of Homer&rsquo;s
Iliad occupied nearly fifty days.</p>
<p><a name="footnote171d"></a><a href="#citation171d">{171d}</a>&nbsp;
The daily operations are somewhat differently stated in the fragments
of the Gododin, which are appended to &ldquo;Gorchan Maelderw.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There they are as follows,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday they put on their splendid robes;<br />On Wednesday
bitter was their assembly;<br />On Thursday messengers formed contracts;<br />On
Friday there was slaughter;<br />On Saturday they dealt mutual blows;<br />On
Sunday they were pierced by ruddy weapons;<br />On Monday a pool of
blood knee deep was seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote172a"></a><a href="#citation172a">{172a}</a>&nbsp;
See lines 27, &amp;c.&nbsp; It would appear as if the three lines at
the end of the stanza were appended to it by some compiler, merely on
account of their uniformity of rhyme.</p>

&ldquo;Aber;&rdquo; the junction of rivers; the fall of a lesser river

Or more definitely,&mdash;&ldquo;Occurred the battle of Aber in front

Or &ldquo;a breach was made, and the knoll was pervaded with fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote172f"></a><a href="#citation172f">{172f}</a>&nbsp;
The stanza is imperfect, which accounts for the omission of the hero&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; From the Gorchan Maelderw we would infer that he was Gwair
one of the three &ldquo;taleithiawg cad,&rdquo; or coronetted chiefs
of battle.&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. ii. 12.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote172g"></a><a href="#citation172g">{172g}</a>&nbsp;

This word may be taken either in its literal sense, as alluding to the
birds of prey that devoured the dead bodies, or else metaphorically
as denoting the warriors themselves.&nbsp; In the latter sense Casnodyn
uses it in the following passage;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cynan&mdash;<br />Eryr tymyr gwyr, gweilch disaesneg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cynan, the eagle of the land of men, who are heroes with no English.</p>
<p>In this sense &ldquo;gwrwnde&rdquo; would necessarily allude to the
colour of the men&rsquo;s habiliments.</p>
<p><a name="footnote173b"></a><a href="#citation173b">{173b}</a>&nbsp;
The stanza is thus varied in Gorchan Maelderw,</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the early dawn of morn they marched<br />To conflict, headed
by the king in front of the course;<br />Gwair was greeted by the fluid
gore<br />In the van of the battle;<br />He was a beloved friend.<br />In

It is not quite clear whether this person be the same with the one mentioned

however, to consider both passages as referring to the same act of treachery.</p>

It will be recollected that the &ldquo;gorgeous pilgrim,&rdquo; (line
534) broke down the encampment; on the supposition, then, that he was
identical with the &ldquo;foe&rdquo; mentioned in the last stanza, we
may imagine him encountering Owain with his badge of truce at the very
breach he was making, and that he then and there put him to death.&nbsp;
It is not impossible, however, but that Owain was another herald who
renewed the offer of peace, after the death of the &ldquo;delight of
the bulwark of toil,&rdquo; and that both were dishonourably slain by
the same perfidious messenger.</p>
<p><a name="footnote175b"></a><a href="#citation175b">{175b}</a>&nbsp;

That is, avenge his death.&nbsp; There is a reference here to the custom
of distributing gifts out of a coffer, suggested by the similarity between
the expressions &ldquo;pridd prenial,&rdquo; the earthly shrine or coffin,
and &ldquo;prid prenial,&rdquo; the price chest.</p>
<p><a name="footnote176b"></a><a href="#citation176b">{176b}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Barn ben&rdquo; might have the sense of <i>adjudged to lose her
head</i>, capitis damnata; in which case the passage would be translated
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a violation of privilege to sentence a woman to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other construction is, however, more especially countenanced
by a similar expression in &ldquo;Gwasgargerdd Vyrddin&rdquo; where
the meaning is obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pan dyvo y brych cadarn<br />Hyt yn Rhyt Pengarn<br />Lliwaut

that the Lady in question is the daughter of Eudav, already mentioned,
upon whose message, as well as that of Mynyddawg, &ldquo;the gay and

as confirmatory of this view, that Eidol was introduced into our notice

As the Lloegrians have been shown before to be clearly amongst the enemies

that the hero under consideration was the conqueror, or the master of

We have repeatedly seen that fire was resorted to in this war, for the
purpose of annoying or destroying the adversary, or else in self defence,
with the view of keeping him at bay.&nbsp; On the part of the Britons
the fire department seems to have been presided over by Morien; and
indeed the title &ldquo;Mynawc,&rdquo; which we have here translated
high-minded, and which is elsewhere connected with the name of Morien,
would induce us to infer that the Bard, in the above stanza, is presenting

A body of British soldiers under the command of Nwython son of Gildas,
and nephew of Aneurin, seem to have taken advantage of the peculiar
position of the enemy, who were now probably unarmed, and to have attacked
them, which caused the latter, as usual, to seek refuge by flight in
one of the neighbouring forts.&nbsp; That we are right in adopting Nwython
as a proper name would appear, moreover, from two different passages
in the fragments of the Gododin subjoined to Gorchan Maelderw, where
&ldquo;the son of Nwython,&rdquo; is distinctly mentioned as one of
the heroes that fell at Cattraeth.</p>

Donald Brec, or as he is called in Latin, Dovenal Varius, king of the
Scots, who was slain by Owain, king of the Strathclyde Britons in the
battle of Vraithe Cairvin, otherwise Calatros, which in sound somewhat
resembles Galltraeth, or Cattraeth.&nbsp; It is true that the Scottish
chronicles assign a much later date to that event, than the era of the
Gododin, nevertheless as they themselves are very inconsistent with
one another on that point, giving the different dates of 629, 642, 678
and 686, it is clear that no implicit deference is due to their chronological
authority, and that we may, therefore, reasonably acquiesce in the view
which identifies Dyvnwal Vrych, with Donald Brec, seeing the striking
similarity which one name bears to the other.</p>

There were two persons who bore this name in the sixth century, the
one was Pryderi the son of Dolor, chief of the people of Deivyr and
Bryneich, and was distinguished with Tinwaed and Rhineri, under the
epithet of the three strong cripples of the isle of Britain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri Gwrddvaglawg ynys Prydain; Rhineri mab Tangwn; a Thinwaed
Vaglawg; a Phryderi mab Doler Deivr a Bryneich.&rdquo;<br />(Triad,
75.)</p>
<p>The other was Pryderi, the son of Pwyll Pen Annwn, a chieftain of
Dyved, which country is by Lewis Glyn Cothi called &ldquo;Gwlad Pryderi;&rdquo;
and by Davydd ab Gwilym, &ldquo;Pryderi dir.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is styled
one of the three strong swineherds of Britain, having tended the swine
of Pendaran his foster father, during the absence of his father in the
unknown world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri Gwrddveichiad ynys Prydain; cyntav vu Pryderi vab Pwyll
Pendaran Dyved, a getwis voch ei dad tra yttoedd yn Annwn; ac yng nglyn

<p>In the Tale of Math Mathonwy, he is said to have been buried at Maen
Tyriawg, near Ffestiniog.&nbsp; We may therefore presume that the Englynion
y Beddau refer to the other in the following passage;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yn Abergenoli y mae Bet Pryderi<br />Yn y terau tormeu tir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Abergenoli is the grave of Pryderi,<br />Where the waves beat
against the shore.</p>
<p>A saying of Pryderi has been thus recorded;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou heard the saying of Pryderi,<br />The wisest person

Geraint, the son of Erbin, was prince of Dyvnaint, (Devon) and one of
the three owners of fleets of the Isle of Britain, each fleet consisting
of 120 ships, and each ship being manned by 120 persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri Llynghesawg ynys Prydain; Geraint mab Erbin; Gwenwynwyn

68, Third series.)</p>
<p>Llywarch Hen wrote an Elegy upon Geraint, in which the place of his
death is thus mentioned;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yn Llongborth y llas Geraint,<br />Gwr dewr o goettir Dyvnaint,<br />Wyntwy
yn lladd gyd a&rsquo;s lleddaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Llongborth was Geraint slain,<br />A strenuous warrior from the
woodland of Dyvnaint,<br />Slaughtering his foes as he fell.</p>
<p>Geraint ab Erbin was the grandfather of Aneurin, but as he died in
king Arthur&rsquo;s time, A.D. 530, we can hardly identify him with
the Geraint of the text, who probably was a son, or some other relation,
that had inherited his fleet.</p>

to the military aspect of his character, might be intended to be conveyed

The sound of the name, in connection with the word &ldquo;hual,&rdquo;
in a former line, makes it very probable that the hero mentioned was
of the tribe of Caswallon Law Hir, celebrated as one of the &ldquo;hualogion
deulu&rdquo; of the Isle of Britain, called so because the men bound
themselves together with the<br />&ldquo;hualau,&rdquo; or fetters of
their horses, to sustain the attack of Serigi Wyddel, whom Caswallon
slew with his own hand, when he drove the Irish out of Anglesey.</p>

&ldquo;Llewyn a llwyvein.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to ascertain
the particular animals which these terms respectively represent.&nbsp;
The former might denote a young lion, a white lion, or any beast in
general to whose eating faculties the word <i>llewa</i> would be applicable.&nbsp;
The latter might signify any animal whose haunts were the elm forests,
or whose property was to <i>llyvu</i> or to lick, as does a dog.&nbsp;
The fox being named llwynog from <i>llwyn</i> a forest, and the forests
in the North being chiefly of elm, it is not unlikely but that the said
animal was frequently called <i>llwyvain</i> in that part of the country
when the Bard wrote, though it is not known now by that name.&nbsp;
It is remarkable that both terms also signify certain kinds of wood.&nbsp;
The former the herb orach, the latter the elm.</p>

******This file should be named gddn10h.htm or gddn10h.zip******

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,
91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this

          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
