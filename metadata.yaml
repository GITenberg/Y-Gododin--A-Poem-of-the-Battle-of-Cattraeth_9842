description: "Y Gododdin (pronounced [ə ɡɔˈdɔðɪn]) is a medieval Welsh poem consisting\
  \ of a series of elegies to the men of the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and its\
  \ allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the Angles\
  \ of Deira and Bernicia at a place named Catraeth in c. AD 600. It is traditionally\
  \ ascribed to the bard Aneirin and survives only in one manuscript, the Book of\
  \ Aneirin.\nThe Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century, but Y\
  \ Gododdin has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries.\
  \ The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh.\
  \ The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably\
  \ in the Hen Ogledd (\"Old North\"); as such it would have been written in the Cumbric\
  \ dialect of Common Brittonic. Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales\
  \ in the 9th, 10th or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of\
  \ the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry.\nThe Gododdin, known in Roman times\
  \ as the Votadini, held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and Northumberland,\
  \ part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363)\
  \ picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd.\
  \ After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth,\
  \ which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days\
  \ of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The\
  \ poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting\
  \ primarily for glory, but is not a narrative. The manuscript contains several stanzas\
  \ which have no connection with the Gododdin and are considered to be interpolations.\
  \ One stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions King Arthur\
  \ in passing, which, if not an interpolation, would be the earliest known reference\
  \ to that character.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
