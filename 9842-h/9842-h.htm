<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Aneurin, the author of this poem, was the son of Caw, lord of
Cwm Cawlwyd, or Cowllwg, a region in the North, which, as we
learn from a Life of Gildas in the monastery of Fleury published
by Johannes a Bosco, comprehended Arecluta or Strath Clyde. <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; Several of his brothers seem to
have emigrated from Prydyn in company with their father before
the battle of Cattraeth, and, under the royal protection of
Maelgwn Gwynedd, to have settled in Wales, where they professed
religious lives, and became founders of churches.&nbsp; He
himself, however, remained behind, and having been initiated into
the mysteries of Bardism, formed an intimate acquaintance with
Owen, Cian, Llywarch Hen, and Taliesin, all likewise disciples of
the Awen.&nbsp; By the rules of his order a Bard was not
permitted ordinarily to bear arms, <a name="citation0b"></a><a
href="#footnote0b" class="citation">[0b]</a> and though the
exceptional case, in which he might act differently, may be said
to have arisen from &ldquo;the lawlessness and depredation&rdquo;
<a name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a> of the Saxons, Aneurin does not appear
to have been present at Cattraeth in any other capacity than that
of a herald Bard.&nbsp; Besides the absence of any intimation to
the contrary, we think the passages where he compares Owen to
himself, and where he makes proposals at the conference, and
above all where he attributes his safety to his
&ldquo;gwenwawd,&rdquo; conclusive on the subject.&nbsp; His
heraldic character would be recognised by all nations, according
to the universal law of warfare, whereas it is very improbable
that any poetic effusion which he might have delivered, could
have influence upon a people whose language differed so
materially from his own.</p>
<p>The Gododin was evidently composed when the various
occurrences that it records were as yet fresh in the
author&rsquo;s mind and recollection.&nbsp; It is divided into
stanzas, which, though they now amount to only ninety-seven, are
supposed to have originally corresponded in point of number with
the chieftains that went to Cattraeth.&nbsp; This is strongly
intimated in the declaration subjoined to Gorchan Cynvelyn, and
cited in the notes at page 86, and thence would we infer that the
Gorchanau themselves are portions of the Gododin, having for
their object the commemoration of the persons whose names they
bear.&nbsp; Of course all of them, with the exception of the
short one of Adebon, contain passages that have been transposed
from other stanzas, which may account for their disproportionate
lengths.&nbsp; This is especially the case with Gorchan Maelderw,
the latter, and by far the greater portion whereof, is in the
Carnhuanawc MS. detached from the former, and separately entitled
&ldquo;Fragments of the Gododin and other pieces of the sixth
century.&rdquo;&nbsp; That they were &ldquo;incantations,&rdquo;
cannot be admitted; and if the word &ldquo;gorchan,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;gwarchan&rdquo; mean here anything except simply &ldquo;a
canon, or fundamental part of song,&rdquo; we should be inclined
to consider it as synonymous with &ldquo;gwarthan,&rdquo; and to
suppose that the poems in question referred to the camps of
Adebon, Maelderw, and Cynvelyn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gwarchan Cynvelyn ar Ododin.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the tenor of the Cynvelyn statement, every stanza
would bring before us a fresh hero.&nbsp; This principle we have
not overlooked in the discrimination and arrangements of proper
names, though owing to evident omissions and interpolations, an
irregularity in this respect occasionally and of necessity
occurs.</p>
<p>Aneurin, like a true poet of nature, abstains from all artful
introduction or invocation, and launches at once into his
subject.&nbsp; His eye follows the gorgeously and distinctively
armed chiefs, as they move at the head of their respective
companies, and perform deeds of valour on the bloody field.&nbsp;
He delights to enhance by contrast their domestic and warlike
habits, and frequently recurs to the pang of sorrow, which the
absence of the warriors must have caused to their friends and
relatives at home, and reflects with much genuine feeling upon
the disastrous consequences, that the loss of the battle would
entail upon these and their dear native land.&nbsp; And though he
sets forth his subject in the ornamental language of poetry, yet
he is careful not to transgress the bounds of truth.&nbsp; This
is strikingly instanced in the manner in which he names no less
than four witnesses as vouchers for the correctness of his
description of Caradawg.&nbsp; Herein he produces one of the
&ldquo;three agreements that ought to be in a song,&rdquo; viz.
an agreement &ldquo;between truth and the marvellous.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a></p>
<p>He also gives &ldquo;relish to his song,&rdquo; <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a> by adopting &ldquo;a diversity of
structure in the metre;&rdquo; for the lyric comes in
occasionally to relieve the solemnity of the heroic, whilst at
the same time the latter is frequently capable of being divided
into a shorter verse, a plan which has been observed in one of
the MSS. used on the present occasion; e. g. the twelfth stanza
is thus arranged,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Gwyr a aeth Gattraeth gan ddydd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neus goreu } gywilydd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O gadeu }<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yn geugant }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A llafn aur llawn anawdd ym bedydd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Goreu yw hyn cyn cystlwn carennydd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ennaint creu } oe henydd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ac angeu }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhag byddin } pan fu ddydd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wawdodyn }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neus goreu dan bwylliad neirthiad gwychydd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But though Aneurin survived the battle of Cattraeth to
celebrate the memory of his less fortunate countrymen in this
noble composition, he also ultimately met with a violent
death.&nbsp; The Triads relate that he was killed by the blow of
an axe, inflicted upon his head by Eiddin son of Einigan, which
event was in consequence branded as one of &ldquo;the three
accursed deeds of the Isle of Britain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g"
class="citation">[0g]</a></p>
<p>His memory, however, lived in the Gododin, and the estimation
in which the poem was held by his successors has earned for him
the title of &ldquo;medeyrn beirdd,&rdquo; the king of
Bards.&nbsp; Davydd Benvras 1190&ndash;1240, prays for that
genius which would enable him</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To sing praises as Aneurin of yore,<br />
The day he sang the Gododin.&rdquo; <a name="citation0h"></a><a
href="#footnote0h" class="citation">[0h]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Risserdyn 1290&ndash;1340 in an Ode to Hywel ab Gruffydd
speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A tongue with the eloquence of Aneurin of
splendid song.&rdquo; <a name="citation0i"></a><a
href="#footnote0i" class="citation">[0i]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Sevnyn 1320&ndash;1378 asserts that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The praise of Aneurin is proclaimed by
thousands.&rdquo; <a name="citation0j"></a><a href="#footnote0j"
class="citation">[0j]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the language in which the medi&aelig;val Bards were
accustomed to talk of the author of the Gododin.</p>
<p>The basis of the present translation is a MS. on vellum
apparently of about the year 1200.&nbsp; In that MS. the lines
are all written out to the margin, without any regard to the
measure.&nbsp; Capital letters are never introduced but at the
beginning of paragraphs, where they are ornamented and coloured
alternately red and green.&nbsp; At page 20 Gwilym Tew and Rhys
Nanmor <a name="citation0k"></a><a href="#footnote0k"
class="citation">[0k]</a> are mentioned as the owners of the
Book, but the names are written in a hand, and with letters more
modern than the MS.&nbsp; It at one time belonged to Mr. Jones
the Historian of Brecknockshire, and came latterly into the
possession of the late Rev. T. Price, with whose Executrix, Mrs.
E. Powell of Abergavenny, it now remains.&nbsp; The author of the
Celtic Researches took a transcript of it, which he communicated
to the Rev. W. J. Rees, of Cascob, who had previously copied the
said transcript by the permission of the Rev. E. Davies.&nbsp;
Mr. Rees&rsquo;s copy was afterwards collated by Dr. Meyer with
Mr. Davies&rsquo;s transcript, and the only inaccuracy which had
crept in was by him carefully corrected.&nbsp; Dr. Meyer again
transcribed Mr. Rees&rsquo;s copy for the use of the present
work, and that version in its turn has been collated by Mr. Rees,
during the progress of the work through the press, with the
transcript in his possession.&nbsp; To these two gentlemen the
translator is under deep obligations.</p>
<p>Also to Mr. Owen Williams of Waunfawr, for the loan of three
other manuscript copies of the Gododin.&nbsp; Two of them occur
in the same book, which purports to have been a transcript made
by the Rev. David Ellis, the first part, A.D. 1775 of an old
book, the second part, June 7, 1777, of a book supposed to have
been written by Sion Brwynog about the year 1550.&nbsp; In these
versions the stanzas are not divided.&nbsp; The third version
appears in a book containing a variety of poems and articles in
prose, of which, however, the writer or copyist is not known,
though one &ldquo;Davydd Thomas&rdquo; is mentioned in a poor
modern hand as being the owner.&nbsp; Our poem is therein headed
&ldquo;Y Gododin.&nbsp; Aneurin ae cant.&nbsp; Gyd&acirc; nodau y
Parchedig Evan Evans.&rdquo;&nbsp; These &ldquo;nodau&rdquo; are
marginal notes, and evidently the different readings of another
version.</p>

<p>Nos 1 and 6 are those which are printed in the Archaiology of
Wales, vol. i.&nbsp; All words that differ in form or meaning,
though not in orthography, from those of No. 7, are duly arranged
at the foot of the page <a name="citation0l"></a><a
href="#footnote0l" class="citation">[0l]</a>, from which it will
be seen that 1, 2, 3, 5, generally agree one with the other,
whilst 4 and 6 also for the most part go together.</p>
<p>It is to be observed, moreover, that though we have taken No.
7 as our text, we have not servilely confined ourself to it, but
that wherever any of the other versions have been considered
preferable, we have unhesitatingly adopted them.&nbsp; The
different meanings, however, are generally inserted in the
notes.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The country situate between the Humber and the Clyde in North
Britain was, for the most part, originally occupied by the Cymry,
who here, as well as in the west, displayed no mean valour in
opposition to the Roman arms.&nbsp; The latter certainly
prevailed; nevertheless it is to be noticed that they did not
finally destroy, nor indeed to any material extent alter the
national features of Prydyn.&nbsp; This is evident from the
manner in which the conquerors thought fit to incorporate into
their own geographical vocabulary many of the local names, which
they found already in use; and above all from the purely
ancestral character which the native chieftains exhibited on
emerging from the Roman ruins in the fifth century.&nbsp; Indeed
to permit the defeated princes, under certain restrictions, to
enjoy their former rights and jurisdictions, was perfectly in
accordance with the usual policy of the Romans, as we may learn
from the testimony of Tacitus, who remarks, in reference to the
British king Cogidunus, that they granted to him certain states
according to ancient custom, and the reason assigned is that they
might have even kings as instruments of slavery. <a
name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a"
class="citation">[1a]</a>&nbsp; The homage of the subjugated
provinces seems to have consisted principally in the payment of a
tribute of money, and the furnishing of soldiers for foreign
service.</p>
<p>Such, no doubt, was the position of Cunedda Wledig, who
&ldquo;began to reign about A.D. 328, and died in 389&rdquo;; <a
name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b"
class="citation">[1b]</a> and who, according to the Historia
Britonum attributed to Nennius, &ldquo;venerat de parte
sinistrali, id est, de regione qu&aelig; vocatur Manau
Guotodin,&rdquo; <a name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c"
class="citation">[1c]</a> the heights of Gododin, and the same
apparently with the territory of the Ottadeni.</p>
<p>In the Myvyrian Archaiology, v. 1, p. 71, is printed an Elegy
on Cunedda, the work of one who had actually partaken of his
royal munificence, who had received from him &ldquo;milch cows,
horses, wine, oil, and a host of slaves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer
with respect to the martial prowess of his patron, observes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Trembling with fear of Cunedda,<br />
Will be Caer Weir and Caer Liwelydd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A hundred times ere his shield was
shattered in battle,<br />
Bryneich obeyed his commands in the conflict.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modern names of the localities, mentioned in these
extracts, are respectively Warwick, Carlisle <a
name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a> and Bernicia.&nbsp; The two latter are
in the immediate vicinity of the Ottadeni; the former, being
further removed, would indicate the direction and extent of his
arms.</p>
<p>From other sources we learn that Cunedda was the son of Edeyrn
ab Padarn Peisrudd, by Gwawl, daughter of Coel Godebog, and that
he was entitled, in right of his mother, to certain territories
in Wales.&nbsp; When these were invaded by the Gwyddyl, his sons,
twelve in number, left their northern home for the purpose of
recovering the same, in which they were successful, though the
enemy was not finally extirpated until the battle at Cerrig y
Gwyddyl, in the succeeding generation.&nbsp; It is asserted by
some that Cunedda accompanied his sons in this expedition, and
that it was undertaken as much through inability to retain
possession of their more immediate dominions, as from the desire
of acquiring or regaining other lands.&nbsp; However, though the
sons settled in Wales and on its borders, it is more accordant
with the drift of the Poem, already cited, to suppose that
Cunedda himself died in the North.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is
undoubted that the native chieftains began to suffer in that part
of the island from barbarian incursions even before the departure
of the Romans.&nbsp; Thus Ammianus Marcellinus, with reference to
the year 364, bears testimony, that &ldquo;the Picts and Saxons
and Scots and Attacots harassed the Britons with continual
oppressions.&rdquo; <a name="citation2b"></a><a
href="#footnote2b" class="citation">[2b]</a></p>
<p>The final abandonment of the island by the Romans occurred,
according to Zosimus, about A.D. 408 or 409, at which time the
native princes arose to the full enjoyment of feudal dignity and
power.&nbsp; In the North, among others, we find Pabo Post
Prydain, a descendant of Coel Godebog in the 4th degree, and
Cynvarch Oer, a member of another branch of the same family; both
of whom, however, were compelled by the inroads of the predatory
hordes, to leave their territories and seek refuge in Wales,
though it would appear that Urien, son of the latter, succeeded
subsequently in recovering his paternal dominion.</p>
<p>The struggle continued, and the enemies had gradually extended
themselves along the coasts, when in 547 they received an
important reinforcement by the arrival of Ida with forty
ships.&nbsp; Gododin, Deivyr, and Bryneich, being situated on the
eastern shore, would be especially exposed to the ravages of
these marauders.&nbsp; Indeed it does not appear that Gododin
ever recovered its pristine independence after the death of
Cunedda, at least we do not hear that any of his sons
subsequently asserted their claims to it, or had anything to do
with the administration of its government: they all seem to have
ended their days in their western dominions.&nbsp; Deivyr and
Bryneich, however, were more fortunate, for we find that they
were ruled as late as the 6th century by British monarchs, among
whom are named Gall, Diffedell, and Disgyrnin, the sons of
Disgyvyndawd; <a name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a> though there is reason to believe that
at that time they were in treacherous alliance with the
Saxons.&nbsp; A Triad positively affirms, that &ldquo;there were
none of the Lloegrwys who did not coalesce with the Saxons, save
such as were found in Cornwall, and in the Commot of Carnoban in
Deivyr and Bryneich.&rdquo; <a name="citation3b"></a><a
href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a>&nbsp; And it is a
remarkable fact, as corroborative of this statement, that the
Cymry ever after, as may be seen in the works of the Bards,
applied the term Bryneich to such of their kindred as joined with
the enemies of their country.</p>
<p>Certain it is, that, at the period of our Poem, the people of
the three provinces in question were open enemies of the Cymry,
as appears from stanzas iii, v, and ix.&nbsp; When we see there
how the Bard commends one hero for not yielding to the army of
Gododin, and celebrates the praise of another who committed an
immense slaughter amongst the men of Deivyr and Bryneich, and
threatens, in the case of a third party, that if they were
suspected of leaning to the Bernician interest, he would himself
raise his hand against them, we can come to no other conclusion
than that those countries were arrayed against the Cymry when the
battle of Cattraeth took place.</p>
<p>Ida had to encounter a powerful opponent in the person of
Urien, king of Rheged, a district in or near which Cattraeth lay,
as we infer from two poems of Taliesin.&nbsp; Thus, one entitled
&ldquo;Gwaith Gwenystrad,&rdquo; commences with the words,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Extol the men of Cattraeth, who, with the
dawn,<br />
Went with their victorious leader<br />
Urien, a renowned elder.&rdquo; <a name="citation3c"></a><a
href="#footnote3c" class="citation">[3c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the other, called &ldquo;Yspail Taliesin,&rdquo; Urien is
styled &ldquo;Glyw Cattraeth,&rdquo; the ruler of Cattraeth. <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; At the same time he is generally
spoken of under the title of Rheged&rsquo;s chief.</p>
<p>The leader of the hostile forces in the battle of Gwenystrad
is not named, but in the battle of Argoed Llwyvein we find him to
be Flamddwyn or the Torch bearer, a name by which the Britons
delighted to designate the formidable Ida.&nbsp;
Flamddwyn&rsquo;s army on this occasion consisted of four
legions, which reached from Argoed to Arvynydd, and against them
were arrayed the men of Goddeu and Rheged, under the command of
Ceneu ab Coel, and Owain, and &ldquo;Urien the prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argoed, bordering on Deivyr and Bryneich, was ruled by
Llywarch Hen, who after his abdication and flight into Powys,
pathetically records the loyal attachment of his former
subjects,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The men of Argoed have ever supported
me.&rdquo; <a name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Historia Britonum enumerates three other kings, who with
Urien fought against the Saxons in the North, viz., Rhydderch,
Gwallawg, and Morgant, though the latter, under the impulse of
envy, procured the assassination of Urien, in the Isle of
Lindisfarne.</p>
<p>After the Saxons had finally established themselves on the
eastern coast, in the forementioned countries, an immense
rampart, extending nearly from the Solway to the Frith of Forth,
was erected, either with the view of checking their further
progress westward, or else by mutual consent of the two nations,
as a mere line of demarcation between their respective
dominions.&nbsp; This wall cannot have an earlier date, for it
runs through the middle of the country originally occupied by the
Gadeni, and could not of course have been constructed as a
boundary by them; nor can it be referred to a more recent period,
as there could be no reason for forming such a fence after the
Saxons had intruded upon the whole country which it
divides.&nbsp; This was the famous <span
class="smcap">Catrail</span>, which we presume to be identical
with <span class="smcap">Cattraeth</span>, where the disastrous
battle of that name, as sung by Aneurin, was fought.</p>
<p>Catrail means literally &ldquo;the war fence&rdquo;
(cad-rhail), but on the supposition that it is synonymous with
Cattraeth, the rhyme in the Gododin would determine the latter to
be the correct term, or that by which Aneurin distinguished the
line.&nbsp; The meaning of Cattraeth would be either &ldquo;the
war tract&rdquo; (cad-traeth), or &ldquo;the legal war
fence&rdquo; (cad-rhaith); the latter of which would give some
countenance to the idea that it was formed by mutual
agreement.</p>
<p>The whole course of the Catrail, which may be traced from the
vicinity of Galashiels to Peel-fell, is upwards of forty five
miles.&nbsp; The most entire parts of it show that it was
originally a broad and deep fosse; having on each side a rampart,
which was formed of the natural soil, that was thrown from the
ditch, intermixed with some stones.&nbsp; Its dimensions vary in
different places, which may be owing to its remains being more or
less perfect.&nbsp; In those parts where it is pretty entire, the
fosse is twenty seven, twenty six, and twenty five feet
broad.&nbsp; But in those places where the rampart has been most
demolished the fosse only measures twenty two and a half feet,
twenty and eighteen, and in one place only sixteen feet
wide.&nbsp; As the ramparts sloped on the inside, it is obvious
that in proportion as they were demolished, the width of the
fosse within would be diminished.&nbsp; In some of the most
entire parts the ramparts are from six to seven, and even nine or
ten feet high, and from eight to ten and twelve feet thick.&nbsp;
They are, no doubt, less now than they were originally, owing to
the effects of time and tillage. <a name="citation5a"></a><a

<p>Such is the Catrail, and were it identical with Cattraeth, we
should naturally expect to meet with some allusions to a work of
that description in the body of the Poem.&nbsp; Nor are we herein
disappointed, for the expressions &ldquo;ffosawd,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> &ldquo;clawdd,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a> &ldquo;ffin,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5d"></a><a href="#footnote5d"
class="citation">[5d]</a> &ldquo;cladd clodvawr,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5e"></a><a href="#footnote5e"
class="citation">[5e]</a> &ldquo;goglawdd,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5f"></a><a href="#footnote5f"
class="citation">[5f]</a> &ldquo;clawdd gwernin,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5g"></a><a href="#footnote5g"
class="citation">[5g]</a> and &ldquo;gorffin Gododin,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5h"></a><a href="#footnote5h"
class="citation">[5h]</a> are undoubtedly such allusions, though
we readily admit that some of them may, and probably do, refer to
the ordinary circular forts of the Britons, of whom there are
several along the line.&nbsp; It may be added here that Taliesin
in his description of the battle of Gwenystrad, where the men of
Cattraeth fought under Urien, speaks of a &ldquo;govwr&rdquo; or
an intrenchment, that was &ldquo;assailed by the laborious toil
of warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus satisfied ourselves as to the nature and locality
of Cattraeth; the general subject of the Poem becomes
apparent.&nbsp; It was a battle fought at the barrier in question
between the Cymry and the Saxons, the most extended in its design
and operations on the part of the former, as it proved to them
the most disastrous in its results, of all that had hitherto
taken place between the two people in that part of the
island.</p>
<p>The details of this bloody encounter, as we gather them from
the Poem, were as follow: At the call of Mynyddawg, lord of
Eiddin, whose dominions lay peculiarly exposed, both by sea and
land, to the attack of the enemy, the native chieftains of
Prydyn, aided by many of their relatives and friends from Gwynedd
and Cernyw, entered into a mutual alliance in behalf of their
common country. <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a>&nbsp; In one place the daughter of
Eudav <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a> is joined with Mynyddawg, as one upon
whose errand the expedition was undertaken, but whether she was
his wife, or ruled over a territory adjacent to, or equally
threatened with his own, does not appear.&nbsp; The troops under
their respective leaders arrived at Eiddin, where they were
sumptuously entertained by Mynyddawg, <a name="citation6c"></a><a
href="#footnote6c" class="citation">[6c]</a> and where they
established their head quarters.&nbsp; The generals named in the
Poem amount in number to about ninety, but this was not the third
part of the whole, which consisted of &ldquo;three hundred and
sixty three chieftains wearing the golden torques.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d"
class="citation">[6d]</a>&nbsp; The aggregate number of men that
followed these illustrious leaders is not told, but if an average
may be formed from what we know respecting a few cases, it will
appear to have been immense.&nbsp; Mynyddawg&rsquo;s retinue
consisted of &ldquo;three hundred;&rdquo; <a
name="citation6e"></a><a href="#footnote6e"
class="citation">[6e]</a> there were &ldquo;five battalions of
five hundred men each,&rdquo; &ldquo;three levies of three
hundred each;&rdquo; &ldquo;three bold knights&rdquo; had each
&ldquo;three hundred of equal quality;&rdquo; <a
name="citation6f"></a><a href="#footnote6f"
class="citation">[6f]</a> thus averaging about four hundred for
each commander, which, multiplied by three hundred and sixty
three, would exhibit an overwhelming army of a hundred and forty
five thousand, and two hundred men!&nbsp; Yet the Poet describes
the numerical advantages possessed by the enemy as greatly
superior.</p>
<p>These forces, being all placed on the western side of the
dyke, would approach the land of their enemies as they marched to
the field of battle, hence the reason why Aneurin uses the
expressions &ldquo;Gwyr a aeth Gattraeth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gwyr
a aeth Gododin,&rdquo; as synonymous.</p>
<p>The enemies, as before observed, were the Saxons, aided on
this occasion by many of the Lloegrians, namely, such of the
natives as had submitted to their sway in the provinces they had
already conquered.&nbsp; They concentrated their forces in
Gododin, and marched westward in the direction of the great
fence, where the Britons were awaiting them.&nbsp; Aneurin has
not thought fit to record the names of any of their generals,
with the single exception of Dyvnwal Vrych, <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a> who, to entitle him to that
distinction, must have figured prominently on the field of
battle.</p>
<p>The engagement commenced on a Tuesday, and continued for a
whole week, the last four days being the most bloody. <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; For some time both parties fought
gallantly, and with almost equal success; fortune perhaps upon
the whole appearing to favour the Cymry, who not only slew a vast
number of their adversaries, but partially succeeded in
recovering their lost dominions. <a name="citation7c"></a><a
href="#footnote7c" class="citation">[7c]</a>&nbsp; At this
critical juncture a dwarfish herald arrived at the fence,
proposing on the part of the Saxons a truce or compact, which,
however, was indignantly rejected by the natives, and the action
renewed. <a name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d"
class="citation">[7d]</a>&nbsp; The scales now rapidly
turned.&nbsp; In one part of the field such a terrible carnage
ensued, that there was but one man left to scare away the birds
of prey, which hovered over the carcases of the slain. <a
name="citation7e"></a><a href="#footnote7e"
class="citation">[7e]</a>&nbsp; In another, where our Bard was
stationed, a portion of the allied army, owing to the absence of
its general, became panic stricken. <a name="citation7f"></a><a
href="#footnote7f" class="citation">[7f]</a>&nbsp; Aneurin was
taken prisoner, hurried off to a cave or dungeon, and loaded with
chains. <a name="citation7g"></a><a href="#footnote7g"
class="citation">[7g]</a>&nbsp; At length a conference was
submitted to, which was held at a place called Llanveithin, at
which Aneurin, who had been forcibly liberated by one of the sons
of Llywarch Hen, insisted upon the restoration of part of
Gododin, or the alternative of continuing the fight.&nbsp; The
Saxon herald met the proposal by killing the British Bard Owain,
who was of course unarmed. <a name="citation7h"></a><a
href="#footnote7h" class="citation">[7h]</a>&nbsp; Such a
violation of privilege excited then the whole energies of the
Cymry, who rose as one man, and gave the entire scene a more
bloody character than it had yet presented.</p>
<p>Victory, however, at length proclaimed in favour of the
usurpers, and so decisively, that out of the three hundred and
sixty three chieftains that went to the field of Cattraeth, three
only returned alive, Cynon, and Cadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant,
besides Aneurin himself. <a name="citation7i"></a><a
href="#footnote7i" class="citation">[7i]</a>&nbsp; The number of
common soldiers that fell must be conjectured.</p>
<p>We have said that the battle commenced on a Tuesday; it would
appear from two passages, namely, where the meeting of reapers in
the hall of Eiddin, <a name="citation7j"></a><a
href="#footnote7j" class="citation">[7j]</a> and the employment
of Gwynwydd in protecting the corn on the highlands, <a
name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a> are spoken of, that the time of year in
which it occurred was the harvest.</p>
<p>It is not, however, so easy to determine the exact year when
all this happened.&nbsp; Neither Arthur nor Urien are mentioned
as being present, and though the stanzas containing their names
may have been lost, it must be admitted that in the case of such
distinguished warriors reason will not warrant the supposition:
the fair inference would be that they were dead at the
time.&nbsp; This view is, moreover, supported by readings of the
Gododin, where certain heroes are compared to the said chiefs
respectively, &ldquo;of Arthur,&rdquo; &ldquo;un Urien,&rdquo;
which would hardly have been done had these latter been
alive.&nbsp; The death of Arthur is placed in the year 542;
Owain, who died at Cattraeth, slew Ida, A.D. 560, and Urien is
said to have been assassinated about 567; the battle under
consideration must have happened subsequently, probably about the
year usually assigned it, viz., 570.&nbsp; This was in the reign
of Rhun, a descendant in the 4th degree of Cunedda Wledig, King
of Gododin!</p>
<p>The vulgar opinion is that the Britons lost the battle in
consequence of having marched to the field in a state of
intoxication; and it must be admitted that there are many
passages in the Poem, which, simply considered, would seem to
favour that view.&nbsp; Nevertheless, granting that the 363
chieftains had indulged too freely in their favourite beverage,
it is hardly credible that the bulk of the army, on which mainly
depended the destiny of the battle, had the same opportunity of
rendering themselves equally incapacitated, or, if we suppose
that all had become so, that they did not recover their sobriety
in seven days!&nbsp; The fact appears to be, that Aneurin in the
instances alluded to, intends merely to contrast the social and
festive habits of his countrymen at home with their lives of toil
and privation in war, after a practise common to the Bards, not
only of that age, but subsequently.&nbsp; Or it may be that the
banquet, at which the British leaders were undoubtedly
entertained in the hall of Eiddin, was looked upon as the sure
prelude to war, and that in that sense the mead and wine were to
them as poison.</p>

<h2>THE GODODIN.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>He was a man in mind, in years a youth, <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a><br />
And gallant in the din of war;<br />
Fleet, thick-maned chargers <a name="citation79b"></a><a
href="#footnote79b" class="citation">[79b]</a><br />
Were ridden <a name="citation79c"></a><a href="#footnote79c"
class="citation">[79c]</a> by the illustrious hero;<br />
A shield, light and broad,<br />
Hung on the flank of his swift and slender steed;<br />
His sword was blue and gleaming,<br />
His spurs were of gold, <a name="citation80a"></a><a
href="#footnote80a" class="citation">[80a]</a> his raiment was
woollen. <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a><br />
It will not be my part<br />
To speak of thee reproachfully,<br />
A more choice act of mine will be<br />
To celebrate thy praise in song;<br />
Thou hast gone to a bloody bier,<br />
Sooner than to a nuptial feast; <a name="citation80c"></a><a
href="#footnote80c" class="citation">[80c]</a><br />
Thou hast become a meal for ravens,<br />
Ere thou didst reach the front of conflict. <a
name="citation80d"></a><a href="#footnote80d"
class="citation">[80d]</a><br />
Alas, Owain! my beloved friend;<br />
It is not meet that he should be devoured by ravens! <a
name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a><br />
There is swelling sorrow <a name="citation82a"></a><a
href="#footnote82a" class="citation">[82a]</a> in the plain,<br
/>
Where fell in death the only son of Marro.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>Adorned with his wreath, leader of rustic warriors, <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> whenever he came<br />
By his troop unattended, <a name="citation83a"></a><a
href="#footnote83a" class="citation">[83a]</a> before maidens
would he serve the mead;<br />
But the front of his shield would be pierced, <a
name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b"
class="citation">[83b]</a> if ever he heard<br />
The shout of war; no quarter would he give to those whom he
pursued;<br />
Nor would he retreat from the combat until blood flowed;<br />
And he cut down like rushes <a name="citation83c"></a><a
href="#footnote83c" class="citation">[83c]</a> the men who would
not yield.<br />
The Gododin relates, that on the coast of Mordei, <a
name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a"
class="citation">[84a]</a><br />
Before the tents of Madog, when he returned,<br />
But one man in a hundred with him came. <a
name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a></p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>Adorned with his wreath, the chief of toil, his
country&rsquo;s rod <a name="citation84c"></a><a
href="#footnote84c" class="citation">[84c]</a> of power,<br />
Darted like an eagle <a name="citation84d"></a><a
href="#footnote84d" class="citation">[84d]</a> to our harbours,
<a name="citation84e"></a><a href="#footnote84e"
class="citation">[84e]</a> when allured<br />
To the compact <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a> that had been formed; his ensign was
beloved, <a name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b"
class="citation">[85b]</a><br />
More nobly was his emblazoned resolution <a
name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c"
class="citation">[85c]</a> performed, for he retreated not,<br />
With a shrinking mind, <a name="citation85d"></a><a
href="#footnote85d" class="citation">[85d]</a> before the host of
Gododin.<br />
Manawyd, <a name="citation85e"></a><a href="#footnote85e"
class="citation">[85e]</a> with confidence and strength thou
pressest upon the tumultuous fight,<br />
Nor dost thou regard <a name="citation86a"></a><a
href="#footnote86a" class="citation">[86a]</a> either spear or
shield;<br />
No habitation rich in dainties can be found,<br />
That has been kept out of the reach of thy warriors&rsquo;
charge. <a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a></p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>Adorned with a wreath was the leader, <a
name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a> the wolf <a name="citation87b"></a><a
href="#footnote87b" class="citation">[87b]</a> of the holme,<br
/>
Amber beads <a name="citation87c"></a><a href="#footnote87c"
class="citation">[87c]</a> in ringlets encircled his temples; <a
name="citation87d"></a><a href="#footnote87d"
class="citation">[87d]</a><br />
Precious was the amber, worth a banquet of wine. <a
name="citation87e"></a><a href="#footnote87e"
class="citation">[87e]</a><br />
He repelled the violence of men, as they glided along;<br />
For Venedotia and the North would have come to his share,<br />
By the advice of the son of Ysgyran, <a name="citation88a"></a><a
href="#footnote88a" class="citation">[88a]</a><br />
The hero of the broken shield. <a name="citation88b"></a><a
href="#footnote88b" class="citation">[88b]</a></p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>Adorned with his wreath was the leader, and armed in the noisy
conflict;<br />
Chief object of observation <a name="citation88c"></a><a
href="#footnote88c" class="citation">[88c]</a> was the hero, and
powerful in the gory field,<br />
Chief fighter <a name="citation88d"></a><a href="#footnote88d"
class="citation">[88d]</a> in the advanced division, in front of
the hosts;<br />
Five battalions <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> fell before his blades;<br />
Even of the men of Deivyr and Bryneich, <a
name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a> uttering groans,<br />
Twenty hundred perished in one short hour;<br />
Sooner did he feed the wolf <a name="citation90a"></a><a
href="#footnote90a" class="citation">[90a]</a> with his carcase,
than go to the nuptial feast; <a name="citation90b"></a><a
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a><br />
He sooner became the raven&rsquo;s prey, than approached the
altar; <a name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a><br />
He had not raised the spear ere his blood streamed to the ground;
<a name="citation90d"></a><a href="#footnote90d"
class="citation">[90d]</a><br />
This was the price of mead in the hall, amidst the throng;<br />
Hyveidd Hir <a name="citation90e"></a><a href="#footnote90e"
class="citation">[90e]</a> shall be celebrated whilst there
remains a minstrel.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Gododin, and Gognaw laughed, <a
name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a><br />
But bitter were they in the battle, <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a> when they stood
arranged according to their several banners;<br />
Few were the years of peace which they had enjoyed;<br />
The son of Botgad caused a throbbing by the energy of his
hand;<br />
They should have gone to churches to do penance,<br />
The old and the young, the bold and the mighty; <a
name="citation91c"></a><a href="#footnote91c"
class="citation">[91c]</a><br />
The inevitable strife of death was about to pierce them.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Gododin, Gwanar <a
name="citation92a"></a><a href="#footnote92a"
class="citation">[92a]</a> laughed,<br />
As his jewelled army <a name="citation92b"></a><a
href="#footnote92b" class="citation">[92b]</a> went down <a
name="citation92c"></a><a href="#footnote92c"
class="citation">[92c]</a> to the terrific toil.<br />
Thou slayest them with blades, when there is not much
chattering;<br />
Thou, powerful supporter of the living law, producest the silence
of death. <a name="citation92d"></a><a href="#footnote92d"
class="citation">[92d]</a></p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth, loquacious was the host;<br
/>
Blue <a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a> mead was their liquor, and it proved
their poison; <a name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b"
class="citation">[93b]</a><br />
In marshalled array they cut through the engines of war; <a
name="citation93c"></a><a href="#footnote93c"
class="citation">[93c]</a><br />
And after the joyful cry, silence <a name="citation93d"></a><a
href="#footnote93d" class="citation">[93d]</a> ensued!<br />
They should have gone to churches to perform penance;<br />
The inevitable strife of death was about to pierce them.</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth, filled with mead and
drunk,<br />
Compact and vigorous; <a name="citation94a"></a><a
href="#footnote94a" class="citation">[94a]</a> I should wrong
them were I to neglect their fame;<br />
Around the mighty, red, and murky blades,<br />
Obstinately and fiercely the dogs of war <a
name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a> would fight;<br />
If I had judged you to be of the tribe of Bryneich, <a
name="citation94c"></a><a href="#footnote94c"
class="citation">[94c]</a><br />
Not the phantom of a man would I have left alive. <a
name="citation94d"></a><a href="#footnote94d"
class="citation">[94d]</a><br />
I lost a friend, myself being unhurt,<br />
As he openly withstood the terror of the parental chief;<br />
Magnanimously did he refuse the dowry of his father-in-law; <a
name="citation94e"></a><a href="#footnote94e"
class="citation">[94e]</a><br />
Such was the son of Cian <a name="citation95a"></a><a
href="#footnote95a" class="citation">[95a]</a> from the stone of
Gwyngwn.</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth with the dawn;<br />
Their peace was disturbed by those who feared them;<br />
A hundred thousand with three hundred <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a> engaged in mutual overthrow;<br />
Drenched in gore, they marked the fall of the lances; <a
name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a><br />
The post of war <a name="citation96b"></a><a href="#footnote96b"
class="citation">[96b]</a> was most manfully and with gallantry
maintained,<br />
Before the retinue of Mynyddawg the Courteous. <a
name="citation96c"></a><a href="#footnote96c"
class="citation">[96c]</a></p>
<h3>XI.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth with the dawn;<br />
Feelingly did their relatives <a name="citation96d"></a><a
href="#footnote96d" class="citation">[96d]</a> regret their
absence;<br />
Mead they drank, yellow, sweet, ensnaring;<br />
That year is the point to which many <a name="citation96e"></a><a
href="#footnote96e" class="citation">[96e]</a> a minstrel
turns;<br />
Redder were their swords than their plumes, <a
name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a"
class="citation">[97a]</a><br />
Their blades were white as lime, <a name="citation97b"></a><a
href="#footnote97b" class="citation">[97b]</a> and into four
parts were their helmets cloven, <a name="citation97c"></a><a
href="#footnote97c" class="citation">[97c]</a><br />
Even those of <a name="citation97d"></a><a href="#footnote97d"
class="citation">[97d]</a> the retinue of Mynyddawg the
Courteous.</p>
<h3>XII.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched to Cattraeth with the day;<br />
Was not the most celebrated of battles disgraced? <a
name="citation97e"></a><a href="#footnote97e"
class="citation">[97e]</a><br />
They put to death <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a> Gelorwydd<br />
With blades. The gem of Baptism <a name="citation98b"></a><a
href="#footnote98b" class="citation">[98b]</a>was thus widely
taunted;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Better that you should, ere you join your kindred,<br />
Have a gory unction <a name="citation98c"></a><a
href="#footnote98c" class="citation">[98c]</a> and death far from
your native homes,<br />
At the hand of the host of Gododin, when the day
arrives.&rdquo;<br />
Is not a hero&rsquo;s power best when tempered with
discretion?</p>
<h3>XIII.</h3>
<p>The hero <a name="citation98d"></a><a href="#footnote98d"
class="citation">[98d]</a> marched to Cattraeth with the day;<br
/>
Truly <a name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a> he quaffed the white mead on serene
nights; <a name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a><br />
Miserable, though success had been predicted, <a
name="citation99c"></a><a href="#footnote99c"
class="citation">[99c]</a><br />
Proved his mission, which he undertook through soaring ambition;
<a name="citation99d"></a><a href="#footnote99d"
class="citation">[99d]</a><br />
There hastened not to Cattraeth<br />
A chief, with such a magnificent design of enterprize<br />
Blazoned on his standard;<br />
Never was there such a host<br />
From the fort of Eiddin, <a name="citation99e"></a><a
href="#footnote99e" class="citation">[99e]</a><br />
That would scatter abroad the mounted ravagers.<br />
Tudvwlch Hir, <a name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a> deprived of <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a> his land and towns,<br />
Slaughtered the Saxons for seven days; <a
name="citation100c"></a><a href="#footnote100c"
class="citation">[100c]</a><br />
His valour should have protected him in freedom; <a
name="citation100d"></a><a href="#footnote100d"
class="citation">[100d]</a><br />
His memory is cherished by his fair <a name="citation100e"></a><a
href="#footnote100e" class="citation">[100e]</a> associates;<br
/>
When Tudvwlch arrived, the supporter of the land, <a
name="citation100f"></a><a href="#footnote100f"
class="citation">[100f]</a><br />
The post of the son of Kilydd <a name="citation100g"></a><a
href="#footnote100g" class="citation">[100g]</a> became a plain
of blood.</p>
<h3>XIV.</h3>
<p>The heroes <a name="citation100h"></a><a href="#footnote100h"
class="citation">[100h]</a> marched to Cattraeth with the
dawn,<br />
But none of them received protection from their shields,<br />
To blood they resorted, being assembled in gleaming armour; <a
name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a><br />
In the van was, loud as thunder, the din of targets. <a
name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b"
class="citation">[101b]</a><br />
The envious, the fickle, and the base,<br />
Would he tear and pierce with halberts;<br />
From an elevated position <a name="citation101c"></a><a
href="#footnote101c" class="citation">[101c]</a> he slew, with a
blade,<br />
In iron affliction, <a name="citation101d"></a><a
href="#footnote101d" class="citation">[101d]</a> their steel-clad
commander; <a name="citation101e"></a><a href="#footnote101e"
class="citation">[101e]</a><br />
He subdued the Mordei that owed him homage; <a
name="citation101f"></a><a href="#footnote101f"
class="citation">[101f]</a><br />
Before Erthai <a name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a> even an army groaned. <a
name="citation102b"></a><a href="#footnote102b"
class="citation">[102b]</a></p>
<h3>XV.</h3>
<p>When the tale shall be told of the battle of Cattraeth,<br />
The people will utter sighs; <a name="citation102c"></a><a
href="#footnote102c" class="citation">[102c]</a> long has been
their grief on account of the warriors&rsquo; absence;<br />
There will be a dominion without a sovereign, <a
name="citation102d"></a><a href="#footnote102d"
class="citation">[102d]</a> and a smoking land.<br />
The sons of Godebog, an upright clan,<br />
Bore the furrower <a name="citation102e"></a><a
href="#footnote102e" class="citation">[102e]</a> on a long
bier.<br />
Miserable <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a> was the fate, though just the
necessity,<br />
Decreed for Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch the Tall; <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a><br />
Together they drank the bright mead by the light <a
name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a> of torches, <a
name="citation103d"></a><a href="#footnote103d"
class="citation">[103d]</a><br />
Though pleasant to the taste, it proved a lasting foe. <a
name="citation103e"></a><a href="#footnote103e"
class="citation">[103e]</a></p>
<h3>XVI.</h3>
<p>Before, above the splendid fort of Eching <a
name="citation103f"></a><a href="#footnote103f"
class="citation">[103f]</a> he shewed a frowning aspect; <a
name="citation103g"></a><a href="#footnote103g"
class="citation">[103g]</a><br />
Whilst young and forward men composed his retinue;<br />
Before, on the Bludwe, <a name="citation104a"></a><a
href="#footnote104a" class="citation">[104a]</a> would the horn
cheer his heart, <a name="citation104b"></a><a
href="#footnote104b" class="citation">[104b]</a><br />
Making all the Mordei full of joy; <a name="citation104c"></a><a
href="#footnote104c" class="citation">[104c]</a><br />
Before, his beverage would be braggett;<br />
Before, he displayed the grandeur of gold and rich purple;<br />
Before, pampered steeds would bear him safe away,<br />
Even Gwarthlev, who deserved a comely name; <a
name="citation104d"></a><a href="#footnote104d"
class="citation">[104d]</a><br />
Before, the victorious chief would turn aside the ebbing tide;<br
/>
His command was ever to go forward, <a name="citation105a"></a><a
href="#footnote105a" class="citation">[105a]</a> loth was he to
skulk.</p>
<h3>XVII.</h3>
<p>And now the early leader,<br />
The sun, is about to ascend,<br />
Sovereign of the revolving <a name="citation105b"></a><a
href="#footnote105b" class="citation">[105b]</a> lights, <a
name="citation105c"></a><a href="#footnote105c"
class="citation">[105c]</a><br />
In the heaven of Britain&rsquo;s isle. <a

class="citation">[105d]</a><br />
Direful was the flight before the shaking<br />
Of the shield of the pursuing victor; <a

class="citation">[105e]</a><br />
Bright <a name="citation105f"></a><a href="#footnote105f"
class="citation">[105f]</a> was the horn<br />
In the hall of Eiddin; <a name="citation105g"></a><a
href="#footnote105g" class="citation">[105g]</a><br />
With pomp was he bidden <a name="citation105h"></a><a
href="#footnote105h" class="citation">[105h]</a><br />
To the feast of intoxicating mead;<br />
He drank the beverage of wine,<br />
At the meeting of reapers; <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a><br />
He drank transparent wine,<br />
With a battle-daring purpose. <a name="citation106b"></a><a
href="#footnote106b" class="citation">[106b]</a><br />
The reapers sang of war,<br />
War with the shining wing; <a name="citation106c"></a><a

The minstrels sang of war,<br />
Of harnessed <a name="citation106d"></a><a href="#footnote106d"
class="citation">[106d]</a> war,<br />
Of winged war.<br />
No shield was unexpanded <a name="citation107a"></a><a
href="#footnote107a" class="citation">[107a]</a><br />
In the conflict of spears;<br />
Of equal age they fell <a name="citation107b"></a><a
href="#footnote107b" class="citation">[107b]</a><br />
In the struggle of battle.<br />
Unshaken in the tumult,<br />
Without dishonour <a name="citation107c"></a><a
href="#footnote107c" class="citation">[107c]</a> did he retaliate
on the foe;<br />
Buried <a name="citation107d"></a><a href="#footnote107d"
class="citation">[107d]</a> was whoever he willed,<br />
Ere the grave of the gigantic <a name="citation107e"></a><a
href="#footnote107e" class="citation">[107e]</a> Gwrveling<br />
Itself became a green sward.</p>
<h3>XVIII.</h3>
<p>The complement <a name="citation107f"></a><a
href="#footnote107f" class="citation">[107f]</a> of the
surrounding country <a name="citation107g"></a><a

Were, three forward chiefs of the Novant&aelig;; <a
name="citation107h"></a><a href="#footnote107h"
class="citation">[107h]</a><br />
Five battalions of five hundred men each; <a

class="citation">[108a]</a><br />
Three levies <a name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a> of three hundred each;<br />
Three hundred knights of battle <a name="citation108c"></a><a
href="#footnote108c" class="citation">[108c]</a><br />
From Eiddin, arrayed in golden armour;<br />
Three loricated hosts,<br />
With three kings wearing the golden torques; <a
name="citation108d"></a><a href="#footnote108d"
class="citation">[108d]</a><br />
Three bold knights,<br />
With three hundred of equal quality;<br />
Three of the same order, mutually jealous,<br />
Bitterly would they chase the foe,<br />
Three dreadful in the toil;<br />
They would kill a lion flat as lead. <a
name="citation108e"></a><a href="#footnote108e"
class="citation">[108e]</a><br />
There was in the war a collection of gold. <a
name="citation108f"></a><a href="#footnote108f"
class="citation">[108f]</a><br />
Three sovereigns of the people<br />
Came from amongst the Brython, <a name="citation109a"></a><a
href="#footnote109a" class="citation">[109a]</a><br />
Cynrig and Cynon <a name="citation109b"></a><a
href="#footnote109b" class="citation">[109b]</a><br />
And Cynrain <a name="citation109c"></a><a href="#footnote109c"
class="citation">[109c]</a> from Aeron, <a
name="citation109d"></a><a href="#footnote109d"
class="citation">[109d]</a><br />
To greet <a name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a> the ashen lances <a
name="citation110b"></a><a href="#footnote110b"
class="citation">[110b]</a><br />
Of the men who dropped from Deivyr. <a name="citation110c"></a><a
href="#footnote110c" class="citation">[110c]</a><br />
Came there from the Brython,<br />
A better man than Cynon,<br />
Who proved a serpent to his sullen foes?</p>
<h3>XIX.</h3>
<p>I drank of the wine and the mead of the Mordei;<br />
Great was the quantity of spears,<br />
In the assembly of the warriors;<br />
He <a name="citation110d"></a><a href="#footnote110d"
class="citation">[110d]</a> was solemnising a banquet for the
eagle.<br />
When Cydywal <a name="citation110e"></a><a href="#footnote110e"
class="citation">[110e]</a> hurried forth to battle, he raised<br
/>
The shout with the green dawn, and dealt out tribulation, <a
name="citation110f"></a><a href="#footnote110f"
class="citation">[110f]</a><br />
And splintered shields about the ground he left,<br />
And darts of awful tearing did he hew down;<br />
In the battle, the foremost in the van he wounded.<br />
The son of Syvno, <a name="citation111a"></a><a
href="#footnote111a" class="citation">[111a]</a> the astronomer,
knew,<br />
That he who sold his life,<br />
In the face of warning,<br />
With sharpened blades would slaughter,<br />
But would himself be slain by spears and crosses. <a
name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b"
class="citation">[111b]</a><br />
According to the compact, <a name="citation111c"></a><a
href="#footnote111c" class="citation">[111c]</a> he meditated a
convenient attack,<br />
And would boast <a name="citation111d"></a><a
href="#footnote111d" class="citation">[111d]</a> of a pile of
carcases<br />
Of gallant men of toil,<br />
Whom in the upper part of Gwynedd <a name="citation111e"></a><a
href="#footnote111e" class="citation">[111e]</a> he pierced.</p>
<h3>XX.</h3>
<p>I drank of the wine and the mead of the Mordei,<br />
And because I drank, I fell by the edge of a gleaming sword, <a
name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a><br />
Not without desiring a hero&rsquo;s prowess; <a
name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a><br />
And when all fell, thou didst also fall. <a
name="citation112c"></a><a href="#footnote112c"
class="citation">[112c]</a><br />
Thus when the issue comes, it were well not to have sinned.<br />
Present, in his thrusting course, showed a bold and mighty arm.
<a name="citation112d"></a><a href="#footnote112d"
class="citation">[112d]</a></p>
<h3>XXI.</h3>
<p>The heroes who marched to Cattraeth were renowned,<br />
Wine and mead out of golden goblets was their beverage,<br />
That year was to them one of exalted solemnity,<br />
Three hundred and sixty-three chieftains, wearing the golden
torques; <a name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a><br />
Of those who hurried forth after the excess of revelling,<br />
But three escaped by valour from the funeral fosse, <a
name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b"
class="citation">[113b]</a><br />
The two war-dogs <a name="citation114a"></a><a
href="#footnote114a" class="citation">[114a]</a> of Aeron, and
Cynon the dauntless, <a name="citation114b"></a><a
href="#footnote114b" class="citation">[114b]</a><br />
And myself, from the spilling of blood, the reward of my candid
song. <a name="citation114c"></a><a href="#footnote114c"
class="citation">[114c]</a></p>
<h3>XXII.</h3>
<p>My friend in real distress, we should have been by none
disturbed,<br />
Had not the white-bannered commander <a
name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a> led forth his army;<br />
We should not <a name="citation115b"></a><a href="#footnote115b"
class="citation">[115b]</a> have been separated in the hall from
the banquet of mead,<br />
Had he not laid waste our convenient groves; <a
name="citation115c"></a><a href="#footnote115c"
class="citation">[115c]</a><br />
He crept into the martial field, he crept into our families. <a
name="citation115d"></a><a href="#footnote115d"
class="citation">[115d]</a><br />
The Gododin relates how that, after the fight in the fosse,<br />
When we had no dwellings, <a name="citation116a"></a><a
href="#footnote116a" class="citation">[116a]</a> none were more
destitute. <a name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b"
class="citation">[116b]</a></p>
<h3>XXIII.</h3>
<p>Scattered, broken, motionless is the weapon, <a
name="citation116c"></a><a href="#footnote116c"
class="citation">[116c]</a><br />
That used to penetrate through the great horde, <a
name="citation116d"></a><a href="#footnote116d"
class="citation">[116d]</a> the numerous <a
name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a"
class="citation">[117a]</a> horde of the Lloegrians. <a
name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b"
class="citation">[117b]</a><br />
Shields were strewn on the sea coast, <a
name="citation117c"></a><a href="#footnote117c"
class="citation">[117c]</a> shields in the battle of lances;<br
/>
Men were reduced to ashes, <a name="citation117d"></a><a
href="#footnote117d" class="citation">[117d]</a><br />
And women rendered widows,<br />
Before his death. <a name="citation117e"></a><a
href="#footnote117e" class="citation">[117e]</a><br />
O Graid, son of Hoewgi, <a name="citation117f"></a><a
href="#footnote117f" class="citation">[117f]</a><br />
With thy spears<br />
Didst thou cause an effusion of blood.</p>
<h3>XXIV.</h3>
<p>There was the hero, with both his shoulders covered, <a
name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a><br />
By a variegated shield, and possessing the swiftness of a warlike
steed;<br />
There was a noise in the mount of slaughter, <a
name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a> there was fire, <a
name="citation118c"></a><a href="#footnote118c"
class="citation">[118c]</a><br />
Impetuous were the lances, there was a sunny gleam, <a
name="citation118d"></a><a href="#footnote118d"
class="citation">[118d]</a><br />
There was food for ravens, the raven there did triumph, <a
name="citation118e"></a><a href="#footnote118e"
class="citation">[118e]</a><br />
And before he would let them go free,<br />
With the morning dew, like the eagle in his glad course,<br />
He scattered them on either side, and like a billow overwhelmed
them in front.<br />
The Bards of the world judge those to be men of valour,<br />
Whose counsels are not divulged to slaves. <a
name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a><br />
The spears in the hands of the warriors were causing
devastation;<br />
And ere was interred under <a name="citation119b"></a><a
href="#footnote119b" class="citation">[119b]</a> the swan-white
steed, <a name="citation119c"></a><a href="#footnote119c"
class="citation">[119c]</a><br />
One who had been energetic in his commands,<br />
His gore had thoroughly washed his armour: <a
name="citation119d"></a><a href="#footnote119d"
class="citation">[119d]</a><br />
Such was Buddvan, <a name="citation119e"></a><a
href="#footnote119e" class="citation">[119e]</a> the son of
Bleiddvan the Bold.</p>
<h3>XXV.</h3>
<p>It were wrong not to record his magnificent feat;<br />
He would not leave an open gap, through cowardice; <a
name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a"
class="citation">[120a]</a><br />
The benefit of Britain&rsquo;s minstrels never quitted his
court<br />
Upon the calends of January; <a name="citation120b"></a><a
href="#footnote120b" class="citation">[120b]</a> according to his
design, <a name="citation120c"></a><a href="#footnote120c"
class="citation">[120c]</a><br />
His land should not be ploughed, though it might become wild;<br
/>
He was a mighty dragon of indignant disposition;<br />
A commander in the bloody field, <a name="citation120d"></a><a
href="#footnote120d" class="citation">[120d]</a> after the feast
of wine,<br />
Was Gwenabwy <a name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"
class="citation">[121a]</a> the son of Gw&ecirc;n, <a
name="citation121b"></a><a href="#footnote121b"
class="citation">[121b]</a> in the strife of Cattraeth.</p>
<h3>XXVI.</h3>
<p>True it was, as the songs relate, <a
name="citation121c"></a><a href="#footnote121c"
class="citation">[121c]</a><br />
No one&rsquo;s steeds <a name="citation121d"></a><a
href="#footnote121d" class="citation">[121d]</a> overtook
Marchleu;<br />
The lances <a name="citation121e"></a><a href="#footnote121e"
class="citation">[121e]</a> hurled by the commanding earl,<br />
In his prancing career, <a name="citation121f"></a><a
href="#footnote121f" class="citation">[121f]</a> strewed a thick
path;<br />
As he had been reared for slaughter by the aid of my mother, <a
name="citation121g"></a><a href="#footnote121g"
class="citation">[121g]</a><br />
Furious was the stroke of his sword whilst lending support to
others; <a name="citation121h"></a><a href="#footnote121h"
class="citation">[121h]</a><br />
Ashen shafts were scattered from the grasp of his hand, <a
name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a><br />
Above the narrow summit <a name="citation122b"></a><a
href="#footnote122b" class="citation">[122b]</a> of the solemn
pile, <a name="citation122c"></a><a href="#footnote122c"
class="citation">[122c]</a><br />
The place where one caused the smoke to ascend; <a
name="citation122d"></a><a href="#footnote122d"
class="citation">[122d]</a><br />
He would slaughter with the blade, whilst his arms were full of
furze; <a name="citation122e"></a><a href="#footnote122e"
class="citation">[122e]</a><br />
As when a reaping comes in the interval of fine weather, <a
name="citation122f"></a><a href="#footnote122f"
class="citation">[122f]</a><br />
Would Marchleu <a name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a> make the blood to flow.</p>
<h3>XXVII.</h3>
<p>Lower down <a name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a> was sent from the southern region, <a
name="citation123c"></a><a href="#footnote123c"
class="citation">[123c]</a><br />
One whose conduct <a name="citation123d"></a><a
href="#footnote123d" class="citation">[123d]</a> resembled the
flowing sea; <a name="citation123e"></a><a href="#footnote123e"
class="citation">[123e]</a><br />
He was full of modesty and gentleness,<br />
When allowed to quaff the mead:<br />
But along the rampart to Offer, <a name="citation123f"></a><a
href="#footnote123f" class="citation">[123f]</a> even to the
point of Maddeu, <a name="citation123g"></a><a
href="#footnote123g" class="citation">[123g]</a><br />
Enraged, he was glutted with carnage, and scattering, with
desolation; <a name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a"
class="citation">[124a]</a><br />
His sword resounded on the heads of mothers;<br />
He was an ardent spirit, <a name="citation124b"></a><a
href="#footnote124b" class="citation">[124b]</a> praise be to
him, the son of Gwyddneu. <a name="citation124c"></a><a
href="#footnote124c" class="citation">[124c]</a></p>
<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
<p>Caredig, <a name="citation124d"></a><a href="#footnote124d"
class="citation">[124d]</a> lovely is his fame;<br />
He would protect and guard his ensign,<br />
Gentle, <a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a"
class="citation">[125a]</a> lowly, calm, before the day
arrived<br />
When he the pomp of war should learn;<br />
When comes the appointed time of the friend of song, <a
name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b"
class="citation">[125b]</a><br />
May he recognise his home in the heavenly region.</p>
<h3>XXIX.</h3>
<p>Ceredig, <a name="citation125c"></a><a href="#footnote125c"
class="citation">[125c]</a> amiable leader,<br />
A wrestler <a name="citation126a"></a><a href="#footnote126a"
class="citation">[126a]</a> in the impetuous <a
name="citation126b"></a><a href="#footnote126b"
class="citation">[126b]</a> fight;<br />
His golden shield dazzled <a name="citation126c"></a><a
href="#footnote126c" class="citation">[126c]</a> the field of
battle,<br />
His lances, when darted, were shivered into splinters,<br />
And the stroke of his sword was fierce and penetrating;<br />
Like a hero would he maintain his post.<br />
Before he received the affliction of earth, <a
name="citation126d"></a><a href="#footnote126d"
class="citation">[126d]</a> before the fatal blow,<br />
He had fulfilled his duty in guarding his station.<br />
May he find a complete reception<br />
With the Trinity in perfect Unity.</p>
<h3>XXX.</h3>
<p>When Caradawg <a name="citation126e"></a><a
href="#footnote126e" class="citation">[126e]</a> rushed into
battle,<br />
It was like the tearing onset of the woodland boar; <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a><br />
Bull of the army in the mangling fight,<br />
He allured the wild dogs by the action of his hand; <a
name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a><br />
My witnesses <a name="citation127c"></a><a href="#footnote127c"
class="citation">[127c]</a> are Owain the son of Eulat,<br />
And Gwrien, and Gwynn, and Gwriad; <a name="citation127d"></a><a
href="#footnote127d" class="citation">[127d]</a><br />
But from Cattraeth, and its work of carnage, <a
name="citation127e"></a><a href="#footnote127e"
class="citation">[127e]</a><br />
From the hill of Hydwn, ere it was gained, <a
name="citation127f"></a><a href="#footnote127f"
class="citation">[127f]</a><br />
After the clear mead was put into his hand,<br />
He saw no more the hill <a name="citation128a"></a><a
href="#footnote128a" class="citation">[128a]</a> of his
father.</p>
<h3>XXXI.</h3>
<p>The warriors marched with speed, together they bounded
onward;<br />
Short lived were they,&mdash;they had become drunk over the
distilled mead.<br />
The retinue of Mynyddawg, renowned <a name="citation128b"></a><a
href="#footnote128b" class="citation">[128b]</a> in the hour of
need;<br />
Their life was the price of their banquet of mead.<br />
Caradawg, <a name="citation128c"></a><a href="#footnote128c"
class="citation">[128c]</a> and Madawg, <a
name="citation128d"></a><a href="#footnote128d"
class="citation">[128d]</a> Pyll, and Ieuan,<br />
Gwgawn, <a name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a"
class="citation">[129a]</a> and Gwiawn, Gwynn <a
name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a> and Cynvan,<br />
Peredur <a name="citation129c"></a><a href="#footnote129c"
class="citation">[129c]</a> with steel arms, Gwawrddur, <a
name="citation129d"></a><a href="#footnote129d"
class="citation">[129d]</a> and Aeddan; <a
name="citation129e"></a><a href="#footnote129e"
class="citation">[129e]</a><br />
A defence were they in the tumult, though with shattered shields;
<a name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a"
class="citation">[130a]</a><br />
When they were slain, they also slaughtered;<br />
Not one to his native home returned.</p>
<h3>XXXII.</h3>
<p>The heroes marched with speed, together were they regaled<br
/>
That year over mead, and mighty was their design;<br />
How sad to mention them, <a name="citation130b"></a><a
href="#footnote130b" class="citation">[130b]</a> how doleful
their commemoration! <a name="citation130c"></a><a
href="#footnote130c" class="citation">[130c]</a><br />
Poison is the home to which they have returned, they are not as
sons by mothers nursed; <a name="citation130d"></a><a
href="#footnote130d" class="citation">[130d]</a><br />
How long our vexation, how long our regret,<br />
For the brave warriors, whose native place was the feast of wine!
<a name="citation130e"></a><a href="#footnote130e"
class="citation">[130e]</a><br />
Gwlyget <a name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a"
class="citation">[131a]</a> of Gododin, having partaken of the
speech inspiring<br />
Banquet of Mynyddawg, performed illustrious deeds, <a
name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a><br />
And paid a price <a name="citation131c"></a><a
href="#footnote131c" class="citation">[131c]</a> for the purchase
of the battle of Cattraeth.</p>
<h3>XXXIII.</h3>
<p>The heroes went to Cattraeth in marshalled array, and with
shout of war, <a name="citation131d"></a><a href="#footnote131d"
class="citation">[131d]</a><br />
With powerful steeds, <a name="citation131e"></a><a
href="#footnote131e" class="citation">[131e]</a> and dark brown
harness, and with shields,<br />
With uplifted <a name="citation131f"></a><a href="#footnote131f"
class="citation">[131f]</a> javelins, and piercing lances,<br />
With glittering mail, and with swords.<br />
He excelled, and penetrated through the host,<br />
Five battalions fell before his blade;<br />
Rhuvawn Hir, <a name="citation132a"></a><a href="#footnote132a"
class="citation">[132a]</a>&mdash;he gave gold <a
name="citation132b"></a><a href="#footnote132b"
class="citation">[132b]</a> to the altar,<br />
And gifts and precious stones <a name="citation132c"></a><a
href="#footnote132c" class="citation">[132c]</a> to the
minstrel.</p>
<h3>XXXIV.</h3>
<p>No hall <a name="citation132d"></a><a href="#footnote132d"
class="citation">[132d]</a> was ever made so eminently
perfect,<br />
So great, so magnificent for the slaughter; <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a><br />
Morien <a name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a> procured <a
name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c"
class="citation">[133c]</a> and spread the fire,<br />
And would not say but that Cynon <a name="citation133d"></a><a
href="#footnote133d" class="citation">[133d]</a> should see <a
name="citation133e"></a><a href="#footnote133e"
class="citation">[133e]</a> the corpse<br />
Of one harnessed, armed with a pike, and of a wide spread fame;
<a name="citation133f"></a><a href="#footnote133f"
class="citation">[133f]</a><br />
His sword resounded on the summit occupied by the camp, <a
name="citation133g"></a><a href="#footnote133g"

Nor was he moved <a name="citation134a"></a><a

course by a ponderous stone from the wall of the fort, <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a><br />
And never again will the son of Peithan <a

class="citation">[134c]</a> be moved.</p>
<h3>XXXV.</h3>
<p>No hall was ever made so impregnable; <a
name="citation134d"></a><a href="#footnote134d"
class="citation">[134d]</a><br />
Had not Morien been like Caradawg, <a name="citation134e"></a><a
href="#footnote134e" class="citation">[134e]</a><br />
The forward Mynawg, <a name="citation134f"></a><a
href="#footnote134f" class="citation">[134f]</a> with his heavy
armour, <a name="citation134g"></a><a href="#footnote134g"
class="citation">[134g]</a> would not have escaped;<br />
Enraged, he was fiercer than the son of Pherawg, <a
name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a><br />
Stout his hand, and, mounted on his steed, <a
name="citation135b"></a><a href="#footnote135b"
class="citation">[135b]</a> he dealt out flames upon the
retreating foe.<br />
Terrible in the city was the cry of the timid multitude,<br />
The van of the army of Gododin was scattered;<br />
His buckler <a name="citation135c"></a><a href="#footnote135c"
class="citation">[135c]</a> was winged with fire for the
slaughter;<br />
In the day of his wrath <a name="citation135d"></a><a
href="#footnote135d" class="citation">[135d]</a> he was
nimble&mdash;a destructive retaliator;<br />
The dependants of Mynyddawg deserved their horns of mead.</p>
<h3>XXXVI.</h3>
<p>No hall was ever made so immoveable<br />
As that of Cynon with the gentle breast, sovereign of the saints;
<a name="citation135e"></a><a href="#footnote135e"
class="citation">[135e]</a><br />
He sat no longer on his elevated throne, <a
name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a"
class="citation">[136a]</a><br />
Whom he pierced were not pierced again, <a
name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b"
class="citation">[136b]</a><br />
Keen was the point of his lance,<br />
It perforated the enamelled armour, it penetrated through the
troops;<br />
Swift in the van were his horses, in front they tore along;<br />
In the day of his anger <a name="citation136c"></a><a
href="#footnote136c" class="citation">[136c]</a> blasting was his
blade,<br />
When Cynon rushed into battle with the green dawn.</p>
<h3>XXXVII.</h3>
<p>A grievous descent was made upon his native territory;<br />
He <a name="citation136d"></a><a href="#footnote136d"
class="citation">[136d]</a> suffered an encroachment&mdash;he
fixed a limit;<br />
His spear forcibly pushed the laughing chiefs of war;<br />
Even as far as Ephyd <a name="citation137a"></a><a
href="#footnote137a" class="citation">[137a]</a> reached the
valour of the forward Elphin:<br />
The furze was kindled by the ardent spirit, the bull of
conflict.</p>
<h3>XXXVIII.</h3>
<p>A grievous descent was made upon his native territory,<br />
The price of mead in the hall, and the feast of wine;<br />
His blades were scattered about between the two hosts;<br />
Illustrious was the knight in front of Gododin;<br />
The furze was kindled by the ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.
<a name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a></p>
<h3>XXXIX.</h3>
<p>A grievous descent was made in front of the extended riches,
<a name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b"
class="citation">[138b]</a><br />
But the army turned aside, with trailing <a
name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c"
class="citation">[138c]</a> shields,<br />
And those shields were shivered before the herd of the roaring
Beli. <a name="citation138d"></a><a href="#footnote138d"
class="citation">[138d]</a><br />
A dwarf from the bloody field hastened to the fence; <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a><br />
And on our side there came a hoary headed man, our chief
counsellor, <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a><br />
Mounted on a prancing iebald psteed, and wearing the golden
chain.<br />
The Boar <a name="citation139c"></a><a href="#footnote139c"
class="citation">[139c]</a> proposed a compact in front of the
course&mdash;the great plotter;<br />
Right worthy <a name="citation139d"></a><a href="#footnote139d"
class="citation">[139d]</a> was the shout of our refusal,<br />
And we cried &ldquo;Let heaven be our protection,<br />
Let his compact be that he should be prostrated by the spear in
battle, <a name="citation139e"></a><a href="#footnote139e"
class="citation">[139e]</a><br />
Our warriors, in respect of their far famed fosse, <a
name="citation139f"></a><a href="#footnote139f"
class="citation">[139f]</a><br />
Would not quarrel if a host were there to press the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>XL.</h3>
<p>For the piercing <a name="citation140a"></a><a

and most learned man, <a name="citation140b"></a><a
href="#footnote140b" class="citation">[140b]</a><br />
For the fair corpse which fell prostrate on the ground,<br />
For the cutting <a name="citation140c"></a><a
href="#footnote140c" class="citation">[140c]</a> of his hair from
his head,<br />
For Gwydien, the eagle of the air, <a name="citation140d"></a><a
href="#footnote140d" class="citation">[140d]</a><br />
Did Gwyddwg <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a"
class="citation">[141a]</a> bring protection to the field, <a
name="citation141b"></a><a href="#footnote141b"
class="citation">[141b]</a><br />
Resembling and honouring his master.<br />
Morien of the blessed song, brought protection<br />
To the ruined hall, <a name="citation141c"></a><a
href="#footnote141c" class="citation">[141c]</a> and cleft the
heads<br />
Of the first in youth, in strength, and in old age.<br />
Equal to three men, though a maid, was Bradwen; <a
name="citation141d"></a><a href="#footnote141d"
class="citation">[141d]</a><br />
Equal to twelve was Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen. <a
name="citation141e"></a><a href="#footnote141e"
class="citation">[141e]</a></p>
<h3>XLI.</h3>
<p>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned woman,<br />
Her servant bore a shield in the action,<br />
And with energy his sword fell upon the heads of the foe;<br />
In Lloegyr the churls cut their way before the chieftain. <a
name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a"
class="citation">[142a]</a><br />
He who grasps the mane of a wolf, without a club <a
name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"
class="citation">[142b]</a><br />
In his hand, will have it gorgeously emblazoned on his robe. <a
name="citation142c"></a><a href="#footnote142c"
class="citation">[142c]</a><br />
In the engagement of wrath and carnage,<br />
Bradwen perished,&mdash;she did not escape.</p>
<h3>XLII.</h3>
<p>Carcases <a name="citation142d"></a><a href="#footnote142d"
class="citation">[142d]</a> of gold mailed warriors lay upon the
city walls;<br />
None of the houses or cities of Christians <a
name="citation142e"></a><a href="#footnote142e"
class="citation">[142e]</a> was any longer actively engaged in
war; <a name="citation142f"></a><a href="#footnote142f"
class="citation">[142f]</a><br />
But one feeble man, with his shouts, kept aloof<br />
The roving birds; <a name="citation143a"></a><a
href="#footnote143a" class="citation">[143a]</a><br />
Truly Syll of Virein <a name="citation143b"></a><a
href="#footnote143b" class="citation">[143b]</a> reports that
there were more<br />
That had chanced to come from Llwy, <a name="citation143c"></a><a

From around the inlet of the flood;<br />
He reports that there were more,<br />
At the hour of mattins, <a name="citation143d"></a><a

Than the morning breeze could well support.</p>
<h3>XLIII.</h3>
<p>When thou, famous conqueror!<br />
Wast protecting the ear of corn in the uplands,<br />
Deservedly were we said to run <a name="citation144a"></a><a
href="#footnote144a" class="citation">[144a]</a> like marked men;
<a name="citation144b"></a><a href="#footnote144b"
class="citation">[144b]</a><br />
The entrance to Din Drei <a name="citation144c"></a><a
href="#footnote144c" class="citation">[144c]</a> was not
guarded,<br />
There was a mountain with riches <a name="citation144d"></a><a
href="#footnote144d" class="citation">[144d]</a> for those who
should approach it,<br />
And there was a city <a name="citation144e"></a><a
href="#footnote144e" class="citation">[144e]</a> for the army
that should venture to enter;<br />
But Gwynwydd&rsquo;s name was not heard where his person was not
seen. <a name="citation144f"></a><a href="#footnote144f"
class="citation">[144f]</a></p>
<h3>XLIV.</h3>
<p>Though there be a hundred men in one house,<br />
I know the cares of war, <a name="citation145a"></a><a

The chief of the men must pay the contribution. <a

<h3>LXV.</h3>
<p>I am not headstrong and petulant,<br />
I will not avenge myself on him who drives me on, <a

class="citation">[145c]</a><br />
I will not laugh in derision;<br />
This particle <a name="citation145d"></a><a href="#footnote145d"
class="citation">[145d]</a> shall go under foot. <a

class="citation">[145e]</a><br />
My limbs <a name="citation145f"></a><a href="#footnote145f"
class="citation">[145f]</a> are racked,<br />
And I am loaded, <a name="citation146a"></a><a
href="#footnote146a" class="citation">[146a]</a><br />
In the subterraneous house;<br />
An iron chain<br />
Passes over my two knees;<br />
Yet of the mead and of the horn, <a name="citation146b"></a><a
href="#footnote146b" class="citation">[146b]</a><br />
And of the host of Cattraeth,<br />
I Aneurin will sing <a name="citation146c"></a><a
href="#footnote146c" class="citation">[146c]</a><br />
What is known to Taliesin,<br />
Who communicates to me his thoughts, <a
name="citation146d"></a><a href="#footnote146d"
class="citation">[146d]</a><br />
Or a strain of Gododin,<br />
Before the dawn of the bright day. <a name="citation146e"></a><a

<h3>XLVI.</h3>
<p>The chief exploit of the North <a name="citation146f"></a><a
href="#footnote146f" class="citation">[146f]</a> did the hero
accomplish,<br />
Of a gentle breast, a more liberal lord could not be seen,<br />
Earth does not support, <a name="citation147a"></a><a
href="#footnote147a" class="citation">[147a]</a> nor has mother
borne<br />
Such an illustrious, powerful, steel clad warrior;<br />
By the force of his gleaming sword he protected me,<br />
From the cruel subterraneous prison he brought me out,<br />
From the chamber of death, from a hostile region;<br />
Such was Ceneu, son of Llywarch, energetic and bold. <a
name="citation147b"></a><a href="#footnote147b"
class="citation">[147b]</a></p>
<h3>XLVII.</h3>
<p>He would not bear the reproach of a congress, <a

class="citation">[147c]</a><br />
Senyllt, <a name="citation147d"></a><a href="#footnote147d"
class="citation">[147d]</a> with his vessels full of
mead;&mdash;<br />
His sword rang <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a"
class="citation">[148a]</a> for deeds of violence,<br />
He shouted and bounded with aid for the war,<br />
And with his arm proved a comprehensive <a

class="citation">[148b]</a> support, <a
name="citation148c"></a><a href="#footnote148c"
class="citation">[148c]</a><br />
Against the armies of Gododin and Bryneich.<br />
Booths for the horses were prepared in the hall, <a
name="citation148d"></a><a href="#footnote148d"
class="citation">[148d]</a><br />
There was streaming gore, and dark brown harness,<br />
And from his hand issued a thread <a name="citation148e"></a><a
href="#footnote148e" class="citation">[148e]</a> of gleam; <a
name="citation148f"></a><a href="#footnote148f"
class="citation">[148f]</a><br />
Like a hunter shooting with the bow<br />
Was Gwen; <a name="citation148g"></a><a href="#footnote148g"
class="citation">[148g]</a> and the attacking parties mutually
pushed each other,<br />
Friend and foe by turns;<br />
The warriors did not cut their way to flee, <a

class="citation">[148h]</a><br />
But were the generous defenders of every region.</p>
<h3>XLVIII.</h3>
<p>To Llech Leucu, <a name="citation149a"></a><a

class="citation">[149c]</a><br />
To the course of Gododin,<br />
And to the course of Ragno, close at hand,<br />
Even that hand which directed the splendour of battle,<br />
With the branch of Caerwys, <a name="citation149d"></a><a
href="#footnote149d" class="citation">[149d]</a><br />
Before it was shattered<br />
By the season of the storm,&mdash;by the storm of the season, <a
name="citation149e"></a><a href="#footnote149e"
class="citation">[149e]</a><br />
To form a rank against a hundred thousand men, <a
name="citation149f"></a><a href="#footnote149f"
class="citation">[149f]</a><br />
Coming from Dindovydd,<br />
In the region of Dyvneint, <a name="citation150a"></a><a
href="#footnote150a" class="citation">[150a]</a><br />
Deeply did they design, <a name="citation150b"></a><a
href="#footnote150b" class="citation">[150b]</a><br />
Sharply did they pierce,<br />
Wholly did they chant,<br />
Even the army with the battered shields;<br />
And before the bull of conflict,<br />
The hostile van was broken.</p>
<h3>XLIX.</h3>
<p>The foes have in sorrow greatly trembled,<br />
Since the battle of most active tumult,<br />
At the border of Ban Carw; <a name="citation150c"></a><a
href="#footnote150c" class="citation">[150c]</a><br />
Round the border of Ban Carw<br />
The fingers of Brych <a name="citation150d"></a><a
href="#footnote150d" class="citation">[150d]</a> were hurt by the
shaft of a spear. <a name="citation150e"></a><a
href="#footnote150e" class="citation">[150e]</a><br />
In defence of Pwyll, <a name="citation150f"></a><a
href="#footnote150f" class="citation">[150f]</a> of Disteir and
Distar,<br />
In defence of Pwyll, of Rodri, and of Rhychwardd,<br />
A stout <a name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a"
class="citation">[151a]</a> bow was spent by Rhys <a
name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"
class="citation">[151b]</a> in Rhiwdrech;<br />
They that were not bold would not attain their purpose;<br />
None escaped that was once overtaken and pierced. <a

<p>Not meetly was his buckler pierced<br />
Upon the flank of his steed; <a name="citation151d"></a><a

Not meetly did he mount <a name="citation152a"></a><a
href="#footnote152a" class="citation">[152a]</a><br />
His long legged, slender, grey charger;<br />
Dark was his shaft, dark,<br />
Darker was his saddle; <a name="citation152b"></a><a

Gnawing the shoulder of a buck, <a name="citation152e"></a><a

<h3>LI.</h3>
<p>It is well that Adonwy came to the support of Gwen; <a

class="citation">[153a]</a><br />
Bradwen <a name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b"
class="citation">[153b]</a> abandoned the foaming brine,<br />
And fought, slaughtered, and burned, though Morien<br />
She did not surpass in martial deeds.<br />
Thou didst not regard the rear or the van<br />
Of the towering, unhelmetted <a name="citation153c"></a><a
href="#footnote153c" class="citation">[153c]</a> presence;<br />
Thou didst not observe the great swelling sea of knights,<br />
That would mangle, and grant no shelter to the Saxons. <a

<p>Gododin! in respect of thee will I demand <a

The dales beyond the ridge of Drum Essyd; <a

The slave, <a name="citation154c"></a><a href="#footnote154c"

himself;<br />
By the counsel of thy son, <a name="citation154d"></a><a

shine forth.<br />
The place appointed for the conference<br />
Was not mean, <a name="citation154e"></a><a href="#footnote154e"
class="citation">[154e]</a> in front of Llanveithin; <a

From twilight to twilight he revelled; <a

Splendid and full was the purple of the pilgrim; <a

He killed the defenceless, <a name="citation154i"></a><a

the bulwark of toil, <a name="citation154j"></a><a

The effects <a name="citation155c"></a><a href="#footnote155c"
class="citation">[155c]</a> of the mead in the hall, and of the
beverage of wine.<br />
Blades were scattered between the two armies<br />

Furze was set on fire by the ardent spirit, the bull of battle.

The encampment is broken down by the gorgeous pilgrim, <a

Where the young deer were in full melody. <a

Amongst the spears of Brych <a name="citation156c"></a><a

Morial <a name="citation156f"></a><a href="#footnote156f"

<p>Together arise the associated <a name="citation156g"></a><a

Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be proclaimed;<br />
There was slaughtering with axes and blades, <a

Seven times their number of Lloegrians had they slain;<br />

The fame <a name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b"

<h3>LVIII.</h3>
<p>After the feast of wine and the banquet of mead,<br />
Enriched with the first fruits of slaughter,<br />
The mother of Spoliation, <a name="citation159e"></a><a
href="#footnote159e" class="citation">[159e]</a><br />
Was the energetic Eidol; <a name="citation159f"></a><a
href="#footnote159f" class="citation">[159f]</a><br />
He honoured the mount of the van, <a name="citation160a"></a><a
href="#footnote160a" class="citation">[160a]</a><br />
In the presence of Victory.<br />
The hovering ravens,<br />
Ascend in the sky; <a name="citation160b"></a><a
href="#footnote160b" class="citation">[160b]</a><br />
The foremost spearmen around him thicken, <a
name="citation160c"></a><a href="#footnote160c"
class="citation">[160c]</a><br />
Like a crop of green barley, <a name="citation160d"></a><a
href="#footnote160d" class="citation">[160d]</a><br />
Without the semblance of a retreat.<br />
Warriors in wonder shake their javelins,<br />
With pouting and pallid lips,<br />
Caused by the keenness of the destructive sword;<br />
From the front of the banquet, deprived of sleep<br />
They vigorously spring forth, <a name="citation161a"></a><a
href="#footnote161a" class="citation">[161a]</a> upon the
awaking<br />
Of the mother <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"

din.</p>
<h3>LIX.</h3>
<p>From the feast of wine and the banquet of mead, they
marched<br />
To the strife of mail-clad warriors; <a
name="citation161c"></a><a href="#footnote161c"
class="citation">[161c]</a><br />
I know no tale of slaughter which records<br />
So complete a destruction.<br />
Before Cattraeth loquacious was the host;<br />
But of the retinue of Mynyddawg, greatly to be deplored, <a
name="citation162a"></a><a href="#footnote162a"
class="citation">[162a]</a><br />
Out of three hundred <a name="citation162b"></a><a
href="#footnote162b" class="citation">[162b]</a> men, only one
returned.</p>
<h3>LX.</h3>
<p>From the feast of wine and the banquet of mead, with speed
they marched,<br />
Men renowned in difficulty, prodigal of their lives;<br />
In fairest order <a name="citation162c"></a><a
href="#footnote162c" class="citation">[162c]</a> round the viands
they together feasted;<br />
Wine and mead and tribute <a name="citation162d"></a><a
href="#footnote162d" class="citation">[162d]</a> they enjoyed.<br
/>
From the retinue of Mynyddawg ruin has come to me; <a
name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a><br />
And I have lost my general <a name="citation163b"></a><a
href="#footnote163b" class="citation">[163b]</a> and <a
name="citation163c"></a><a href="#footnote163c"
class="citation">[163c]</a> my true friends.<br />
Of the regal army of three hundred men that hastened to
Cattraeth,<br />
Alas! none have returned, save one alone.</p>
<h3>LXI.</h3>
<p>Impetuous as a ball, <a name="citation163d"></a><a

And on his horse would he be found, when not at home;<br />
Yet illusive <a name="citation163e"></a><a href="#footnote163e"
class="citation">[163e]</a> was the aid which he brought against
Gododin;<br />
For though apart from the wine and mead he was unrestrained,<br

He perished <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a> on the course;<br />
And red stained warriors ride <a name="citation164b"></a><a

Thou tramplest upon those who in strong mail are clad,<br />
In front of the army; <a name="citation164e"></a><a

Like an enraged bear, guarding and assaulting, <a

Thou tramplest upon the furious, <a name="citation165a"></a><a

In the day of capture,<br />
In the dank entrenchment; <a name="citation165b"></a><a

Like the mangling dwarf, <a name="citation165c"></a><a

A banquet for the birds,<br />

<h3>LXIII.</h3>
<p>It is incumbent to sing of the complete acquisition<br />

With confusion and blood, and treading and trampling;<br />
Men of toil <a name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a"
class="citation">[166a]</a> were trampled because of the
contribution of mead in the horn; <a name="citation166b"></a><a

But the carnage of the combatants <a name="citation166c"></a><a

Cannot be described even by the cup of bounty, <a

After the excitement of the battle is over,<br />
Notwithstanding so much splendid eloquence.</p>
<h3>LXIV.</h3>
<p>It is incumbent to sing of so much renown,<br />
The tumult of fire, of thunder, and tempest,<br />
The glorious gallantry of the knight of conflict. <a

The ruddy reapers of war are thy desire, <a

Thou man of toil, <a name="citation167c"></a><a

The whole length of the land shall hear of thee in battle;<br />
With thy shield upon thy shoulder, thou dost incessantly

flows <a name="citation167f"></a><a href="#footnote167f"

As the contribution <a name="citation168a"></a><a

<p>It is incumbent to sing of the gay and illustrious tribes, <a

class="citation">[168c]</a><br />
That, after the fatal fight, <a name="citation168d"></a><a

Their grasp satisfied the hunger <a name="citation168f"></a><a

Clwyd, <a name="citation168g"></a><a href="#footnote168g"

And prepared food for the birds of prey.<br />
Of those who went to Cattraeth, wearers of the golden chain,<br

Upon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,<br />
There came not honourably <a name="citation169a"></a><a

class="citation">[169b]</a> of the Brython,<br />
To Gododin, a hero from afar who was better than Cynon.</p>
<h3>LXVI.</h3>
<p>It is incumbent to sing of so many men of skill, <a

Who in their halls <a name="citation169d"></a><a

Ambitious <a name="citation169f"></a><a href="#footnote169f"

Eidol <a name="citation169g"></a><a href="#footnote169g"

But notwithstanding gold, and fine steeds, and intoxicating
mead,<br />
Only one man of these, who loved the world, returned,<br />
Cynddilig of Aeron, one of the Novantian heroes. <a

<h3>LXVII.</h3>
<p>It is incumbent to sing of the gay and illustrious tribes,<br

That went upon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the
people,<br />
And the daughter <a name="citation170a"></a><a

Tall, of a faultless gait, <a name="citation170b"></a><a

Apparelled in her purple robes, thoroughly and truly
splendid.</p>
<h3>LXVIII.</h3>
<p>The soldiers <a name="citation171a"></a><a

praise of the Holy One,<br />
And in their <a name="citation171b"></a><a href="#footnote171b"
class="citation">[171b]</a> presence was kindled a fire that
raged on high.<br />
On Tuesday they put on their dark-brown garments; <a
name="citation171c"></a><a href="#footnote171c"
class="citation">[171c]</a><br />
On Wednesday they purified their enamelled armour;<br />
On Thursday their destruction was certain;<br />
On Friday was brought carnage all around;<br />
On Saturday their joint labour was useless;<br />
On Sunday their blades assumed a ruddy hue;<br />
On Monday was seen a pool knee deep of blood. <a
name="citation171d"></a><a href="#footnote171d"
class="citation">[171d]</a><br />
The Gododin relates that after the toil,<br />
Before the tents of Madog, when he returned,<br />
Only one man in a hundred with him came. <a

class="citation">[172a]</a></p>
<h3>LXIX.</h3>
<p>At the early dawn of morn, <a name="citation172b"></a><a
href="#footnote172b" class="citation">[172b]</a><br />
There was a battle at the fall of the river, <a
name="citation172c"></a><a href="#footnote172c"
class="citation">[172c]</a> in front of the course; <a
name="citation172d"></a><a href="#footnote172d"
class="citation">[172d]</a><br />
The pass and the knoll were pervaded with fire; <a
name="citation172e"></a><a href="#footnote172e"
class="citation">[172e]</a><br />
Like a boar didst thou <a name="citation172f"></a><a
href="#footnote172f" class="citation">[172f]</a> lead to the
mount;<br />
The wealth <a name="citation172g"></a><a href="#footnote172g"
class="citation">[172g]</a> of the hill, and the place,<br />
And the dark brown hawks <a name="citation173a"></a><a
href="#footnote173a" class="citation">[173a]</a> were stained
with gore. <a name="citation173b"></a><a href="#footnote173b"
class="citation">[173b]</a></p>
<h3>LXX.</h3>
<p>Quickly rising, in a moment of time, <a
name="citation173c"></a><a href="#footnote173c"
class="citation">[173c]</a><br />
After kindling a fire at the confluence, <a
name="citation173d"></a><a href="#footnote173d"
class="citation">[173d]</a> in front of the fence, <a
name="citation173e"></a><a href="#footnote173e"
class="citation">[173e]</a><br />
After leading his men in close array,<br />
In front of a hundred he pierces the foremost. <a
name="citation173f"></a><a href="#footnote173f"
class="citation">[173f]</a><br />
Sad it was that you should have made a pool of blood,<br />
As if you but drank mead in the midst of laughter; <a
name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a><br />
But it was brave of you to slay the little man, <a
name="citation174b"></a><a href="#footnote174b"
class="citation">[174b]</a><br />
With the fierce and impetuous stroke of the sword;<br />
For like the unrestrained ocean <a name="citation174c"></a><a
href="#footnote174c" class="citation">[174c]</a> had the foe <a
name="citation174d"></a><a href="#footnote174d"
class="citation">[174d]</a> put to death<br />
A man, who would otherwise have been in rank his equal.</p>
<h3>LXXI.</h3>
<p>He fell headlong down the precipice, <a
name="citation174e"></a><a href="#footnote174e"
class="citation">[174e]</a><br />
And the bushes <a name="citation174f"></a><a href="#footnote174f"
class="citation">[174f]</a> supported not his noble <a
name="citation174g"></a><a href="#footnote174g"
class="citation">[174g]</a> head;<br />
It was a violation of privilege to kill him on the breach, <a
name="citation175a"></a><a href="#footnote175a"
class="citation">[175a]</a><br />
It was a primary law that Owain should ascend upon the course, <a
name="citation175b"></a><a href="#footnote175b"
class="citation">[175b]</a><br />
And extend before the onset the branch of peace, <a
name="citation175c"></a><a href="#footnote175c"
class="citation">[175c]</a><br />
And that he should pursue the study of meet <a
name="citation175d"></a><a href="#footnote175d"
class="citation">[175d]</a> and learned strains.<br />
Excellent man, the assuager of tumult and battle,<br />
Whose very grasp dreaded a sword, <a name="citation175e"></a><a
href="#footnote175e" class="citation">[175e]</a><br />
And who bore in his hand an empty corslet. <a
name="citation175f"></a><a href="#footnote175f"
class="citation">[175f]</a><br />
O sovereign, dispense rewards<br />
Out of his earthly shrine. <a name="citation176a"></a><a

<h3>LXXII.</h3>
<p>Eidol, with frigid blood and pale complexion,<br />
Spreading carnage, when the maid was supreme in judgment; <a
name="citation176b"></a><a href="#footnote176b"

Owner of horses and strong trappings,<br />
And transparent <a name="citation176c"></a><a

Instantaneously makes an onset,&mdash;ascending and
descending.</p>
<h3>LXXIII.</h3>
<p>The leader of war with eagerness <a name="citation177a"></a><a

battle,<br />
Mallet of the land, <a name="citation177b"></a><a
href="#footnote177b" class="citation">[177b]</a> he loved the
mighty reapers; <a name="citation177c"></a><a
href="#footnote177c" class="citation">[177c]</a><br />
Stout youth, the freshness of his form was stained with blood,<br
/>
His accoutrements resounded, his chargers made a clang; <a
name="citation177d"></a><a href="#footnote177d"
class="citation">[177d]</a><br />
His cheeks <a name="citation177e"></a><a href="#footnote177e"
class="citation">[177e]</a> are covered with armour,<br />
And thus, image of death, he scatters desolation in the toil;<br
/>
In the first onset his lances penetrate the targets, <a
name="citation177f"></a><a href="#footnote177f"
class="citation">[177f]</a><br />
And a track of surrounding light is made by the aim of the
darting of his spears.</p>

And the cellar, <a name="citation178d"></a><a

and where was brewed <a name="citation178e"></a><a

The mead, that sweet ensnarer.<br />
With the dawn does Gwrys <a name="citation178f"></a><a

Penance he inflicts until repentance ensues; <a

May the dependants of Gwynedd hear of his renown;<br />
With his ashen shaft he pierces to the grave;<br />
Pike of the conflict of Gwynedd,<br />
Bull of the host, oppressor of the battle of princes; <a

Though thou hast kindled the land <a name="citation179b"></a><a

At the extreme boundary <a name="citation179c"></a><a

<h3>LXXV.</h3>
<p>Involved in vapours was the man <a name="citation179d"></a><a

High minded, bitter handed leader of the forces; <a

He was expert, and ardent, and stately,<br />
Though at the social banquet he was not harsh. <a

class="citation">[180a]</a><br />
They <a name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b"

And with a clang the sock <a name="citation180f"></a><a

A successful warrior was Fflamddwr <a name="citation180g"></a><a

<h3>LXXVII.</h3>
<p>He supported martial steeds and harness of war;<br />
Drenched with gore, on the red-stained field of Cattraeth,<br />
The foremost shaft in the host is held by the consumer of forts,

The brave <a name="citation181b"></a><a href="#footnote181b"

We are called to the gleaming <a name="citation181c"></a><a

From the raging flame of Eiddyn <a name="citation182b"></a><a

He stationed men of firmness in command, <a

And the thick covering guard <a name="citation182e"></a><a

van,<br />
And vigorously he descended upon the scattered foe;<br />
In that he had revelled, he likewise sustained the main

Save one man by slow steps, thoroughly weakened, and tottering
every way. <a name="citation182f"></a><a href="#footnote182f"

But traversed the strand <a name="citation183a"></a><a

Firmly he grasped in his hand a blue blade,<br />
And a shaft ponderous as the chief priest&rsquo;s <a

He rode a grey stately <a name="citation183c"></a><a

And beneath his blade there was a dreadful fall of slaughter;<br

When overpowered <a name="citation183d"></a><a

<p>Blessed Conqueror, of temper mild, the strength <a
name="citation184d"></a><a href="#footnote184d"
class="citation">[184d]</a> of his people,<br />
With his blue streamers displayed towards the sea-roving foes. <a
name="citation185a"></a><a href="#footnote185a"
class="citation">[185a]</a><br />
Brave is he on the waters, most numerous his host;<br />
Manly his bosom, loud his shout in the charge of arms.<br />
Usual was it for him <a name="citation185b"></a><a
href="#footnote185b" class="citation">[185b]</a> to make a
descent before nine armaments, <a name="citation185c"></a><a
href="#footnote185c" class="citation">[185c]</a><br />
With propulsive strokes, <a name="citation185d"></a><a
href="#footnote185d" class="citation">[185d]</a> in the face of
blood and of the country.<br />
I love thy victorious throne, which teemed with harmonious
strains.<br />
O Cynddilig of Aeron, <a name="citation185e"></a><a
href="#footnote185e" class="citation">[185e]</a> thou
lion&rsquo;s whelp.</p>
<h3>LXXXII.</h3>
<p>I could wish to have been the first to shed my blood in
Cattraeth,<br />
As the price <a name="citation186a"></a><a href="#footnote186a"
class="citation">[186a]</a> of the mead and beverage of wine in
the hall;<br />
I could wish to have been hurt by the blade of the sword,<br />
Ere he was slain on the green plain of Uphin. <a
name="citation186b"></a><a href="#footnote186b"
class="citation">[186b]</a><br />
I loved the son of renown, who sustained the bloody fight, <a
name="citation186c"></a><a href="#footnote186c"
class="citation">[186c]</a><br />
And made his sword descend upon the violent.<br />
Can a tale of valour be related before Gododin,<br />
In which the son of Ceidiaw <a name="citation186d"></a><a
href="#footnote186d" class="citation">[186d]</a> has not his fame
as a man of war?</p>
<h3>LXXXIII.</h3>
<p>Sad it is for me, after all our toil,<br />
To suffer the pang of death through indiscretion;<br />
And doubly grievous and sad for me to see<br />
Our men falling headlong to the ground, <a
name="citation187a"></a><a href="#footnote187a"
class="citation">[187a]</a><br />
Breathing the lengthened sigh, and covered with reproaches.<br />
After the strenuous warriors have extended their country&rsquo;s
bounds,<br />
Rhuvawn <a name="citation187b"></a><a href="#footnote187b"
class="citation">[187b]</a> and Gwgawn, <a
name="citation187c"></a><a href="#footnote187c"
class="citation">[187c]</a> Gwiawn and Gwlyged, <a
name="citation187d"></a><a href="#footnote187d"
class="citation">[187d]</a><br />
Men at their post most gallant, valiant in difficulties,<br />
May their souls, now that their conflict is ended, <a
name="citation187e"></a><a href="#footnote187e"
class="citation">[187e]</a><br />
Be received into the heavenly region, the abode of
tranquillity.</p>
<h3>LXXXIV.</h3>
<p>Tres repelled the foe through <a name="citation188a"></a><a
href="#footnote188a" class="citation">[188a]</a> a pool of
gore,<br />
And slaughtered like a hero such as asked no quarter, <a
name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b"
class="citation">[188b]</a><br />
With a sling and a spear; <a name="citation188c"></a><a
href="#footnote188c" class="citation">[188c]</a>&mdash;he flung
off his glass goblet<br />
Containing the mead, <a name="citation188d"></a><a
href="#footnote188d" class="citation">[188d]</a> and in defence
of his sovereignty overthrew an army;<br />
His counsel always prevailed, and the multitude would not speak
before him, <a name="citation188e"></a><a href="#footnote188e"
class="citation">[188e]</a><br />
Whilst those that were cowards were not left alive,<br />
Before the onset of his battle-axes, <a
name="citation188f"></a><a href="#footnote188f"
class="citation">[188f]</a> and his sharpened sword, <a
name="citation188g"></a><a href="#footnote188g"
class="citation">[188g]</a><br />
And where his blue banner was seen to wave. <a
name="citation188h"></a><a href="#footnote188h"
class="citation">[188h]</a></p>
<h3>LXXXV.</h3>
<p>There was a reinforcement of <a name="citation189a"></a><a
href="#footnote189a" class="citation">[189a]</a> troops,<br />
A supply of penetrating weapons,<br />
And a host of men in the vanguard,<br />
Presenting a menacing front;<br />
In the days of strenuous exertion,<br />
In the eager conflict,<br />
They displayed their valour.<br />
After the intoxication,<br />
When they drank the mead,<br />
Not one was spared.<br />
Though Gorwylam<br />
Was awhile successful,<br />
When the retort was made, it broke the charge<br />
Of the horses and men, by fate decreed.</p>
<h3>LXXXVI.</h3>
<p>When the host of Pryder <a name="citation189b"></a><a
href="#footnote189b" class="citation">[189b]</a> arrives,<br />
I anxiously count <a name="citation190a"></a><a
href="#footnote190a" class="citation">[190a]</a> the bands,<br />
Eleven complete battalions;<br />
There is now a precipitate flight <a name="citation190b"></a><a
href="#footnote190b" class="citation">[190b]</a><br />
Along the road of lamentation.<br />
Affectionately have I deplored, <a name="citation190c"></a><a
href="#footnote190c" class="citation">[190c]</a><br />
Dearly have I loved,<br />
The illustrious dweller of the wood, <a
name="citation190d"></a><a href="#footnote190d"
class="citation">[190d]</a><br />
And the men of Argoed, <a name="citation190e"></a><a
href="#footnote190e" class="citation">[190e]</a><br />
Accustomed, in the open plain, <a name="citation191a"></a><a
href="#footnote191a" class="citation">[191a]</a><br />
To marshal their troops.<br />
For the benefit of the chiefs, the lord of the war <a
name="citation191b"></a><a href="#footnote191b"
class="citation">[191b]</a><br />
Laid upon rough <a name="citation191c"></a><a
href="#footnote191c" class="citation">[191c]</a> boards,<br />
Midst a deluge of grief,<br />
The viands for the banquet,<br />
Where they caroused together;&mdash;he conducted us to a bright
<a name="citation191d"></a><a href="#footnote191d"
class="citation">[191d]</a> fire,<br />
And to a carpet of white and fresh <a name="citation191e"></a><a
href="#footnote191e" class="citation">[191e]</a> hide.</p>
<h3>LXXXVII.</h3>
<p>Geraint, <a name="citation191f"></a><a href="#footnote191f"
class="citation">[191f]</a> from the South, did raise a shout,<br
/>
And on the white water <a name="citation192a"></a><a
href="#footnote192a" class="citation">[192a]</a> was his buckler
pierced. <a name="citation192b"></a><a href="#footnote192b"
class="citation">[192b]</a><br />
Lord of the spear, a gentle lord!<br />
The praise of mountain and sea<br />
Will he render our youth, even thou, Geraint, wilt render
them,<br />
Who hast been a generous commander.</p>
<h3>LXXXVIII.</h3>
<p>Instantaneously is his fame wafted on high;<br />
His anchors <a name="citation192c"></a><a href="#footnote192c"
class="citation">[192c]</a> from the scene of action <a
name="citation192d"></a><a href="#footnote192d"
class="citation">[192d]</a> cannot be restrained.<br />
Unflinching eagle <a name="citation192e"></a><a
href="#footnote192e" class="citation">[192e]</a> of the forward
heroes,<br />
He bore the toil, and brilliant was his zeal;<br />
The fleetest coursers he outstripped in war,<br />
But was quite a lamb <a name="citation193a"></a><a
href="#footnote193a" class="citation">[193a]</a> when the wine
from the goblet flowed.<br />
Ere he reached the grassy tomb, and his cheeks became pale in
death, <a name="citation193b"></a><a href="#footnote193b"
class="citation">[193b]</a><br />
He presided over the banquet of mead, and honoured it with the
generous horn. <a name="citation193c"></a><a href="#footnote193c"
class="citation">[193c]</a></p>
<h3>LXXXIX.</h3>
<p>Ruin <a name="citation193d"></a><a href="#footnote193d"
class="citation">[193d]</a> he brought upon every fair region, <a
name="citation193e"></a><a href="#footnote193e"
class="citation">[193e]</a><br />
And a fettering valour he displayed; <a
name="citation193f"></a><a href="#footnote193f"
class="citation">[193f]</a><br />
The front of his shield was pierced.<br />
Caso Hir, <a name="citation194a"></a><a href="#footnote194a"
class="citation">[194a]</a> when roused to anger,<br />
Defended Rhuvoniawg. <a name="citation194b"></a><a
href="#footnote194b" class="citation">[194b]</a><br />
A second time they <a name="citation194c"></a><a
href="#footnote194c" class="citation">[194c]</a> challenged, <a
name="citation194d"></a><a href="#footnote194d"
class="citation">[194d]</a> and were crushed<br />
By the warlike steeds with gory trappings.<br />
His martial nobles <a name="citation194e"></a><a
href="#footnote194e" class="citation">[194e]</a> formed a firm
array,<br />
And the field was reddened, when he was greatly affronted;<br />
Severe in the conflict, with blades he slaughtered,<br />
And sad news <a name="citation194f"></a><a href="#footnote194f"
class="citation">[194f]</a> from the war he brought,<br />
Which he wove <a name="citation195a"></a><a href="#footnote195a"
class="citation">[195a]</a> into a song for the calends of
January. <a name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a><br />
Adan, <a name="citation195c"></a><a href="#footnote195c"
class="citation">[195c]</a> the son of Ervai, there did
pierce,<br />
Adan pierced the haughty boar;<br />
Even he, who was like a dame, a virgin, and a hero. <a
name="citation195d"></a><a href="#footnote195d"
class="citation">[195d]</a><br />
And when the youth thus possessed the properties of a king, <a
name="citation195e"></a><a href="#footnote195e"
class="citation">[195e]</a><br />
He, stained with blood, brought deliverance to Gwynedd,<br />
Ere the turf was laid upon the gentle face<br />
Of the generous dead; but now undisturbed<br />
In regard to fame and gain, he reposes in the grave,<br />
Namely, Garthwys Hir, <a name="citation196a"></a><a
href="#footnote196a" class="citation">[196a]</a> from the land of
Rhuvoniawg.</p>
<h3>XC.</h3>
<p>The garment of Tinogad, <a name="citation196b"></a><a
href="#footnote196b" class="citation">[196b]</a> which was of
divers colours,<br />
Made of the speckled skins of young wolves,<br />
His jerks and starts and juggling motion,<br />
I fain would lampoon, they were lampooned by his eight slaves. <a
name="citation196c"></a><a href="#footnote196c"
class="citation">[196c]</a><br />
When thy father went out to hunt,<br />
With his pole upon his shoulder, and his provisions in his
hand,<br />
He would call to his dogs that were of equal size,<br />
Catch it, catch it&mdash;seize it, seize it&mdash;bring it, bring
it;<br />
He would kill a fish in his coracle,<br />
Even as a princely lion in his fury <a name="citation197a"></a><a
href="#footnote197a" class="citation">[197a]</a> kills his
prey;<br />
When thy father climbed up the mountain,<br />
He brought back the head <a name="citation197b"></a><a
href="#footnote197b" class="citation">[197b]</a> of a roebuck, <a
name="citation197c"></a><a href="#footnote197c"
class="citation">[197c]</a> the head of a wild boar, the head of
a stag,<br />
The head of a grey moor hen from the hill,<br />
The head of a fish from the falls of the Derwent; <a
name="citation197d"></a><a href="#footnote197d"
class="citation">[197d]</a><br />
As many as thy father could reach with his flesh piercer,<br />
Of wild boars, lions, and foxes, <a name="citation197e"></a><a
href="#footnote197e" class="citation">[197e]</a><br />
It was certain death to them all, <a name="citation197f"></a><a
href="#footnote197f" class="citation">[197f]</a> unless they
proved too nimble.</p>
<h3>XCI.</h3>
<p>Were he to narrow <a name="citation198a"></a><a
href="#footnote198a" class="citation">[198a]</a> my dominions
through extortion, <a name="citation198b"></a><a
href="#footnote198b" class="citation">[198b]</a><br />
The arrival of no enemy would prove to me more formidable. <a
name="citation198c"></a><a href="#footnote198c"
class="citation">[198c]</a><br />
The man has not been nursed who could be more festive in the
hall<br />
Than he, or steadier in the field of battle.<br />
On the ford of Penclwyd <a name="citation198d"></a><a
href="#footnote198d" class="citation">[198d]</a> Pennant were his
steeds;<br />
Far spread was his fame, compact was his armour;<br />
And ere the long grass covered him beneath the sod,<br />
He, the only son of Morarch, <a name="citation198e"></a><a
href="#footnote198e" class="citation">[198e]</a> poured out the
horns of mead.</p>
<h3>XCII.</h3>
<p>I saw the array from the highland of Adoen,<br />
Carrying the sacrifice to the omen fire; <a
name="citation199a"></a><a href="#footnote199a"
class="citation">[199a]</a><br />
I saw the two, <a name="citation199b"></a><a href="#footnote199b"
class="citation">[199b]</a> who from their station quickly and
heavily fell;<br />
By the commands of Nwython, greatly were they afflicted.<br />
I saw the warriors, who had made the great breach, approaching
with the dawn, <a name="citation199c"></a><a href="#footnote199c"
class="citation">[199c]</a><br />
And the head of Dyvnwal Vrych by ravens devoured.</p>
<h3>XCIII.</h3>
<p>Gododin, in respect of thee will I demand, <a
name="citation199d"></a><a href="#footnote199d"
class="citation">[199d]</a><br />
In the presence <a name="citation199e"></a><a
href="#footnote199e" class="citation">[199e]</a> of a hundred
that are named <a name="citation199f"></a><a href="#footnote199f"
class="citation">[199f]</a> with deeds of valour,<br />
And of Gwarthan the son of Dwywau, <a name="citation200a"></a><a
href="#footnote200a" class="citation">[200a]</a> of gallant
bravery,<br />
Let Tre Essyd be ours in one entire dale. <a
name="citation200b"></a><a href="#footnote200b"
class="citation">[200b]</a><br />
Since the stabbing of the delight of the bulwark of battle,<br />
Since Aneurin was under ground, <a name="citation200c"></a><a
href="#footnote200c" class="citation">[200c]</a><br />
My voice has not been divorced from Gododin.</p>
<h3>XCIV.</h3>
<p>Echo speaks of the formidable <a name="citation200d"></a><a
href="#footnote200d" class="citation">[200d]</a> and dragon-like
<a name="citation200e"></a><a href="#footnote200e"
class="citation">[200e]</a> weapons,<br />
And of the fair game, <a name="citation200f"></a><a
href="#footnote200f" class="citation">[200f]</a> which was played
in front of the unclaimed course of Gododin.<br />
Profusely did he bring a supply <a name="citation200g"></a><a
href="#footnote200g" class="citation">[200g]</a> of wine into the
tents, for the benefit of the natives, <a
name="citation200h"></a><a href="#footnote200h"
class="citation">[200h]</a><br />
In the season of the storm, as long as it trickled from the
vessels,<br />
And the army, a well nourished host, continued to drop in.<br />
A splendid troop of warriors, successful against a hundred
men,<br />
Is led from Dindovydd in Dyvneint. <a name="citation201a"></a><a
href="#footnote201a" class="citation">[201a]</a><br />
Before Doleu <a name="citation201b"></a><a href="#footnote201b"
class="citation">[201b]</a> in battle, worn out were the shields,
and battered the helmets.</p>
<h3>XCV.</h3>
<p>He brought ruin upon every fair region, <a
name="citation201c"></a><a href="#footnote201c"
class="citation">[201c]</a><br />
And a fettering valour he displayed;<br />
The front of his shield was pierced;<br />
Caso Hir, arrayed in pomp, <a name="citation201d"></a><a
href="#footnote201d" class="citation">[201d]</a><br />
Protected Rhuvoniawg.<br />
A second time were they wounded, <a name="citation201e"></a><a
href="#footnote201e" class="citation">[201e]</a> and crushed<br
/>
By his warlike steeds, and gore-stained were their coffins. <a
name="citation201f"></a><a href="#footnote201f"
class="citation">[201f]</a><br />
Always immoveable, always liberal of aid,<br />
Would be his gallant nobles, when roused to anger.<br />
Severe in the conflict, with blades he slaughtered;<br />
And agonising news from the war he brought,<br />
Which he wove into a hundred songs for the calends of January.<br
/>
Adan <a name="citation202a"></a><a href="#footnote202a"
class="citation">[202a]</a> the son of Urvei there did pierce,<br
/>
Adan pierced the haughty boar,<br />
Even he who was like Urien, <a name="citation202b"></a><a
href="#footnote202b" class="citation">[202b]</a> a maid, and a
hero.<br />
And as the youth was thus endowed with the properties of a
king,<br />
Lord of Gwynedd, and of the blood of Cilydd, <a
name="citation202c"></a><a href="#footnote202c"
class="citation">[202c]</a> he proved our deliverer;<br />
Ere the turf was laid upon the face of the generous dead,<br />
Wisely did he seek the field, with praise and high sounding
fame:<br />
The grave of Gorthyn Hir <a name="citation202d"></a><a
href="#footnote202d" class="citation">[202d]</a> is seen <a
name="citation202e"></a><a href="#footnote202e"
class="citation">[202e]</a> from the highlands of Rhuvoniawg.</p>
<h3>XCVI.</h3>
<p>On account of the piercing of the skilful and most learned
man, <a name="citation203a"></a><a href="#footnote203a"
class="citation">[203a]</a><br />
On account of the fair corpse, which fell prostrate upon the
ground,<br />
Thrice six officers judged the atrocious deed <a
name="citation203b"></a><a href="#footnote203b"
class="citation">[203b]</a> at the hour of mattins,<br />
And Morien lifted up again his ancient lance,<br />
And, roaring, stretched out <a name="citation203c"></a><a
href="#footnote203c" class="citation">[203c]</a> death<br />
Towards the warriors, the Gwyddyl, <a name="citation203d"></a><a
href="#footnote203d" class="citation">[203d]</a> and the Prydyn;
<a name="citation203e"></a><a href="#footnote203e"
class="citation">[203e]</a><br />
Whilst towards the lovely, slender, blood-stained body of
Gwen,<br />
Sighed Gwenabwy, the only son of Gwen.</p>
<h3>XCVII.</h3>
<p>On account of the afflicting <a name="citation203f"></a><a
href="#footnote203f" class="citation">[203f]</a> of the skilful
and most learned man<br />
Grievously and deeply, when he fell prostrate upon the ground,<br
/>
The banner was pompously <a name="citation204a"></a><a
href="#footnote204a" class="citation">[204a]</a> unfurled, and
borne by a man in the flank; <a name="citation204b"></a><a
href="#footnote204b" class="citation">[204b]</a><br />
A tumultuous scene was beheld <a name="citation204c"></a><a
href="#footnote204c" class="citation">[204c]</a> in Eiddin, and
on the battle field.<br />
The grasp of his hand performed deeds of valour<br />
Upon the Cynt, <a name="citation204d"></a><a href="#footnote204d"
class="citation">[204d]</a> the Gwyddyl, and the Prydyn.<br />
He who meddles with the mane of a wolf, without a club<br />
In his hand, will have it gorgeously emblazoned on his robe.<br
/>
Fain would I sing,&mdash;&ldquo;would that Morien had not
died.&rdquo;<br />
I sigh for Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen. <a

<p>which reading would be supported by the allusion to the
nuptial feast in the preceding passage.&nbsp; Nevertheless the
term &ldquo;argynrein,&rdquo; occurring in three other copies,
would certainly point to the signification given in the text;
&ldquo;argyvrein&rdquo; being capable of the same meaning, whilst
&ldquo;argynrein&rdquo; has no reference whatever to the nuptial
dowry.</p>
<p><a name="footnote81a"></a><a href="#citation81a"
class="footnote">[81a]</a>&nbsp; The manner in which the person
here commemorated is associated with the ravens, leads us to
suspect that he was none other than Owain ab Urien, who is
traditionally reported to have had an army of ravens in his
service, by which, however, we are probably to understand an army
of men with those birds emblazoned on their standard, even as his
descendants still bear them in their coats of arms.&nbsp; Not
only do the Welsh Romances and Bards of the middle ages allude to
these ravens, but even Taliesin and Llywarch Hen, seem pointedly
to connect them with Urien or his son.&nbsp; Thus the former in
an Ode on the battle of Argoed Llwyvaen, (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p.
53) in which Owain commanded the Cumbrian forces, under his
father against Ida, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A rhag gwaith Argoed Llwyfain<br />
Bu llawer celain<br />
Rhuddei frain rhag rhyfel gwyr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of the battle of Argoed Llwyvain,<br />
There happened many a dead carcase,<br />
And the ravens were coloured with the war of men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Llywarch Hen in his &ldquo;Elegy on Urien Rheged&rdquo;
has the following expressions;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pen a borthav ar vy nhu; Pen Urien,<br />
Llary, llyw ei lu;<br />
Ac ar ei vron wen vran ddu.</p>
<p>Pen a borthav mywn vy nghrys; pen Urien,<br />
Llary llywiai lys:<br />
Ac ar ei vron wen vran ai hys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bear by my side a head; the head of Urien,<br />
The mild leader of his army;<br />
And on his white bosom the sable raven is perched.</p>
<p>I bear in my shirt a head; the head of Urien,<br />
That governed a court with mildness;<br />
And on his white bosom the sable raven doth glut.&nbsp;
(Owen&rsquo;s Ll. Hen. p. 24.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This supposition would considerably enhance the point and
beauty of the passage in the text; for a sad or unbecoming thing,
indeed, (&ldquo;cwl,&rdquo; <i>a fault</i>) would it be that one
who fought by the aid of ravens should himself be eventually
devoured by them.</p>
<p>Moreover, a tradition prevails, that Owain the son of Urien
was actually engaged in the battle of Cattraeth.&nbsp; Thus Lewis
Glyn Cothi, a poet of the fifteenth century, observes;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bwriodd Owain ab Urien<br />
Y tri thwr yn Nghattraeth hen.<br />
Ovnodd Arthur val goddaith<br />
Owain, ei vrain a&rsquo;i fon vraith.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I. 140.)</p>
<p>Owain son of Urien overthrew<br />
The three towers of Cattraeth of old;<br />
Arthur dreaded, as the flames,<br />
Owain, his ravens, and his parti-coloured staff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to the view which would identify our hero with the son of
Urien there is this objection, that the poem describes the former
as the son of Marro or Marco; nor can the difficulty be got over,
without supposing that this was another name of Urien.&nbsp; Or
if that be inadmissible, the line, in which Owain&rsquo;s name
occurs, may be translated,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Alas, the beloved friend of Owain;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>an alteration, which will do no great violence to the allusion
about the ravens.</p>

(cyn-taiawg.)&nbsp; Adopting this version for the sake of
variety, and under the impression that all the different readings
of this poem are not the mere result of orthographical accident,
but that the forms of obscure or illegible words were sometimes
determined by tradition, we must believe that the
<i>taiogion</i>, who composed the army of Madog, were simply his
own tenants or dependants.</p>
<p><a name="footnote83a"></a><a href="#citation83a"
class="footnote">[83a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Diffun,&rdquo;
(di-ffun.)&nbsp; <i>Ffun</i> is any thing united together, and is
used at line 803 for a band of men.&nbsp; Some read
&ldquo;diffyn,&rdquo; (protection or defence) and in that case
the sense of the passage would seem to be,</p>
<p>He brought protection to women, and mead he distributed.</p>
<p>The former reading is preferred, inasmuch as it exhibits in a
more natural and consistent manner the twofold character of
Madog, as a soldier and a courtier, which appears to be the
object of the Bard to delineate.&nbsp; Our inference on this
point is moreover supported by more obvious passages of that
description, which occur again in the Poem, such as,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ragorei veirch racvuan<br />
En trin lletvegin gwin o bann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He surpassed the fleetest steeds<br />
In war, but was a tame animal when he poured the wine from the
goblet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The epithet &ldquo;cynhaiawc,&rdquo; assuming it to be the
proper term, would also, by reason of its contrasting effect,
considerably enhance the value of our hero&rsquo;s domestic and
social courtesy.</p>

to a shield, and this sense is, moreover, supported by
&ldquo;tyllant tal ysgwydawr,&rdquo; in Taliesin&rsquo;s Ode on
Gwallawg, as well as &ldquo;rac twll y gylchwy,&rdquo; used by
Cynddelw.&nbsp; The meaning therefore appears to be that wherever
the battle raged, there would the chief be found, so boldly and
<i>directly</i> fighting as to have the very boss of his shield
perforated by the spears of his enemy.</p>

the practice which the Welsh Bards commonly had of adapting their
descriptive similes to the names, armorial bearings, or some
other peculiarities of their heroes, we may infer that the
chieftain, who is celebrated in this stanza, is none other than
Madog ab Brwyn.&nbsp; Indeed one copy reads &ldquo;mab
brwyn,&rdquo; the son of Brwyn, rather than <i>mal</i> brwyn, as
above.&nbsp; He is distinguished in the Triads with Ceugant
Beilliog and Rhuvon, under the appellation of the &ldquo;three
golden corpses,&rdquo; because their weight in gold was given by
their families to have their bodies delivered up by the
enemy.&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. vol. ii. p. 69.)&nbsp; Madog ab Brwyn
was the grandson of Cunedda Wledig, lord of Gododin.</p>

the different stanzas of the Gododin, albeit regular links of the

in itself, and therefore that it would be more natural, where the
drift of the paragraph allowed, or seemed to have that tendency,
to look out for the names of the chiefs, who may be thus
distinctly introduced; according to the tenor of the following
declaration which is appended to &ldquo;Gorchan
Cynvelyn.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Myv. Arch. vol. i. page 61.)</p>

<p>Every Ode of the Gododin is equivalent to a single song,
according to the privilege of poetical competition.&nbsp; Each of
the incantations is equal to three hundred and sixty-three songs,
because the number of the men who went to Cattraeth is
commemorated in the Incantations, and as no man should go to
battle without arms, so no Bard ought to contend without that
Poem.</p>

<p>It is true that in the Vellum MS. as transcribed by Davies,
this does not form a distinct stanza, but is a continuation of
the preceding one.&nbsp; Nevertheless in other copies a detached
position is given to it, which seems required also by the opening
sentence, and particularly by the rhyme.</p>

Arch. vol. ii. p. 68) flowing through a portion thereof.&nbsp; In
a document which has been published in the Iolo MSS. Argoed
Derwennydd, (Derwent wood probably) and the river Trenn or Trent,
are mentioned as the extreme boundaries of the region.&nbsp; The
triads moreover speak of the three sons of Dysgyvedawg, (or
Dysgyvyndawd) viz. Gall, Difedel, and Ysgavnell, under the
appellation of the &ldquo;three monarchs of Deivyr and
Bryneich,&rdquo; (Ibid. p. 64) about the period, as it would
appear, of our Poem.</p>
<p>It is clear from the above passage in the Gododin, as well as
from those lines, (78, 79.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ar deulu brenneych beych barnasswn<br />
Dilyw dyn en vyw nys adawsswn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I had judged you to be of the tribe of Bryneich,<br />
Not the phantom of a man would I have left alive;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that the people of those countries were not at the time in
question on friendly terms with the neighbouring Britons; which
circumstance is further apparent from the contemporary testimony
of Llywarch Hen, who speaks of Urien as having conquered the land
of Bryneich;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Neus gorug o dir Brynaich.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, it is true, might have a reference to the Saxon tribes,
who had succeeded at an early period, in establishing themselves
along the coast in that part of the island, yet the disparaging
manner in which the grave of Disgyrnin Disgyfedawt, evidently the
father of the &ldquo;three monarchs,&rdquo; is spoken of in the
Englynion y Beddau, inclines us strongly to the belief that it
was the Aborigines themselves who were thus guilty of treason to
the common weal.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cigleu don drom dra thywawd,<br />
Am vedd Dysgyrnyn Dysgyveddawd,<br />
Aches trwm angwres pechawd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hear the sullen wave beyond the strand,<br />

<p>The circumstance of his being thus a poet, and classed with

between the latter and his son.</p>
<p>Cian is said to have been the servant of Peris, and to them

</blockquote>
<p>Another reading gives &ldquo;cwydaw&rdquo; to fall, in

of the prevailing colour of the dress or armour of the men,</p>

whether of native origin, or derived from the custom of the
Romans, prevailed to some extent among the Britons of the fifth
and sixth century, and seems to have denoted a certain degree of
power on the part of the owners.&nbsp; Taliesin the Druid boasts

being named llwynog from <i>llwyn</i> a forest, and the forests
in the North being chiefly of elm, it is not unlikely but that
the said animal was frequently called <i>llwyvain</i> in that

now by that name.&nbsp; It is remarkable that both terms also
signify certain kinds of wood.&nbsp; The former the herb orach,

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
